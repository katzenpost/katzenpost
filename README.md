# Katzenpost Mix Network

## Post Quantum Anonymous Communication Network

![build badge](https://github.com/katzenpost/katzenpost/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)

Katzenpost is a software project dedicated to designing and implementing
mix network protocols. A mix network is a type of anonymous communication network
that is message oriented rather than stream oriented in it's design.

We build anonymous protocols so that everyone can communicate more freely
in this age of pervasive surveillance.

Our model of Katzenpost as three cryptographic protocols layers:

1. Post Quantum Noise cryptographic protocol
that routes messages over the Internet. Can use either TCP or QUIC.

2. Post Quantum NIKE/KEM Sphinx cryptographic packet protocol layer
   which mixes, routes and cryptographically transforms Sphinx packets at each hop.

3. Post Quantum cryptographic application protocol layer, for example,
   post quantum double ratchet that uses a hybrid NIKE with CTIDH and X25519.
