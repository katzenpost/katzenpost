.. rubric:: Abstract

This is a specification for the Katzenpost/LEAP mix network client
end to end protocol and egress mix behavior. The mix network
specification is described in Katzenpost Mix Network Specification
[KATZMIXNET]_. The protocols used by mixes to publish their
identities is described in the Katzenpost Mix Network PKI
Specification [KATZMIXPKI]_.

1. Introduction
===============

Fundamentally a mix network is a lossy packet switching network on
which we can build reliable protocols. We therefore utilize a
variety of ideas from both the mix network and classical internet
protocol literature to design an end to end reliability protocol
that utilizes the mix network.

1.1. Terminology
----------------

* ``ACK`` - A protocol acknowledgment of a previously sent Block.

* ``ARQ`` - Automatic Repeat reQuest is an error correction method
  which requires two-way communication and incurs a delay penalty
  when used.

* Classes of traffic - We distinguish the following classes of traffic:

  * ACKs
  * Forward messages

* ``Block`` - A fragment of a message that fits into a single packet
  of a specified class of traffic.

* ``Block ID`` - A unique identifier for a Block.

* ``Client`` - Software run by the human being on its local device.

* ``E2E Encrypted message`` - An encrypted message.

* ``Message`` - A variable size end-to-end message, transmitted from
  one location to another. The message can be classified into one
  of the classes of traffic, depending on the message size, and transported
  as a single packet or divided into several packets.

* ``Message ID`` - A unique identifier for a message.

* ``Mix`` - A server that provides anonymity to clients by accepting
  messages encrypted to its public key, which it then decrypts,
  delays for a given amount of time, and transmits either to
  another mix or to a provider (as specified in the messages). Those
  operations provide bitwise unlinkability between input and output
  messages as well as long term correlation resistance.

* ``Provider`` - The provider is a client's single point of failure for
  participating in the mix network because it is responsible for
  authorising sent messages as well as storing received messages on
  behalf of the user. Provider MUST perform the same cryptographic
  operations as the Mix.

* ``Packet`` - A Sphinx packet.The Katzenpost system supports multiple
  packet sizes for different classes of traffic. In particular:

  * ``XKB-block: XX KB`` (to-do: specify the number of KB)
  * ``YKB-block: YY KB`` (to-do: specify the number of KB/MB)

* ``SURB-ACK`` - A short message notifying that a packet was delivered;
  transmitted via a Single Use Reply Block [SPHINX]_.

* ``SURB_SIZE = sizeof(SphinxSURB)`` where ``SphinxSURB`` is a Single Use
  Reply Block defined in the “Sphinx Mix Network Cryptographic
  Packet Format Specification”.

1.2 Conventions Used in This Document
-------------------------------------

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]_.

The "C" style Presentation Language as described in [RFC5246]_
Section 4 is used to represent data structures, except for
cryptographic attributes, which are specified as opaque byte
vectors.

* ``byte`` - An 8-bit octet.

1.3 Constants
-------------

* ``BLOCK_LENGTH`` - The maximum payload size of a block (message fragment).
  The value of ``BLOCK-LENGTH`` depends on the class of traffic.

2. Mix Network Packet Format Considerations
===========================================

As the mix network message packet format we use Sphinx, as
specified:
"Sphinx Mix Network Cryptographic Packet Format Specification",
[SPHINXSPEC]_.

The Sphinx cryptographic primitives and parameters are specified in
Section 3 of: "The Katzenpost Mix Network Specification",
[KATZMIXNET]_.

3. Client and Provider Core Protocol
====================================

All client mixnet interaction happens through their Provider,
reusing the existing trust relationship any given user may have
with an e-mail service provider, and all client to Provider
interaction will use the Katzenpost Mix Network Wire Protocol,
described in “Katzenpost Mix Network Wire Protocol Specification”,
[KATZMIXWIRE]_.

3.1 Handshake and Authentication
--------------------------------

Let the contents of the wire protocol AuthenticateMessage's
``additional_data`` field consist of the local-part component of a
client's e-mail address if the client is authenticating, padded
with NUL bytes to exactly 64 bytes in length.

In the case that the authenticating party is a Provider instance,
let the ``additional_data`` field contain the domain name that the
Provider is responsible for mail for.

3.2 Client Retrieval of Queued Messages
---------------------------------------

Clients periodically poll their Provider for messages that may have
been enqueued in that user's mailbox. All wire protocol commands
including these defined commands MUST come after the above
described handshake and authentication. We define two additional
wire protocol commands::

      enum {
          /* Extending the wire protocol Commands. */
          retrieve_message(16),
          message(17),
      } Command;

The structures of these commands are defined as follows::

      struct {
          uint32_t sequence_number;
      } RetrieveMessage;

      enum {
          ack(0),
          message(1),
          empty(2),
      } message_type;

      struct {
          opaque surb_id[SURB_ID_LENGTH];
          opaque encrypted_payload[SURB_PAYLOAD_LENGTH];
      } Ack;

      struct {
          opaque encrypted_payload[PAYLOAD_LENGTH];
          opaque padding[sizeof(Ack) - PAYLOAD_LENGTH];
      } MessageCiphertext;

      struct {
          message_type type;
          uint8_t queue_size_hint;
          uint32 sequence_number;
          select (message_type) {
              case ack:    Ack;
              default:     MessageCiphertext;
          };
      } Message;

3.2.1 The retrieve_message and message Commands
-----------------------------------------------

Once a client is connected to the Provider and has entered the data
transfer phase after completing the handshake and authentication, the
client may start to retrieve messages from the provider via issuing
the ``retrieve_message`` command.

The ``retrieve_message`` command contains a sequence number which the
client initially sets to ``0`` at the beginning of each session. This
sequence number is incremented each time the client receives a message
from the provider (as a message command), except if the ``message_type``
is ``empty`` indicating that the client's inbound message queue is
empty, as no message has been received.

Clients MUST NOT have more than one outstanding retrieve_message
command at a given time.

The Provider MUST respond to retrieve_message commands, in the
following manner:

1. Validate that the ``sequence_number`` is in the expected range, and
   that there are no other ``retrieve_message`` commands originating
   from a particular session being serviced. If the ``sequence_number``
   is unexpected, or the client is issuing multiple
   ``retrieve_message`` commands, the session MUST be terminated.

2. If the sequence_number has been incremented, indicating that
   the client has received the last ``message`` reply, remove the 0th
   message from the client's message queue and delete it securely.

3. Send a message command as a response, with the following values
   for the ``Message`` fields (as the command's payload).

   * ``type`` - The type of the message that is being transported.

   * ``queue_size_hint`` - The size of the client's inbound message
     queue, excluding the message currently being sent,
     clamped to 255.

   * ``sequence_number`` - The sequence number of the retrieve_message.

If the 0th message is a SURB-ACK:

   * ``surb_id`` - The SURB's identifier taken from the
     SURBReplyCommand in the Sphinx packet header
     that delivered the SURB.

     If the message type empty, a ``MessageCiphertext`` is still
     embedded in the Message structure, however the contents MUST
     be zero filled (filled with ``0x00`` bytes).

Clients MAY use the ``queue_size_hint`` to determine if additional
retreive_message commands should be issued soon, or if they can
delay the next retreive_message under the assumption that the queue
is empty.

Providers SHOULD attempt to service ``retrieve_message`` commands in a
timely manner.

4. Client and Provider processing of received packets
=====================================================

This section describes the protocol that reliably transmits
messages across the mix network to the destination Provider.

It is assumed that all clients have a long lived X25519 keypair, the
public component of which is known in advance to all peers who wish
to communicate securely with them. How to distribute such keying
information is beyond the scope of this document.

Messages begin at the sender as byte strings containing an e-mail
in the Internet Message Format (IMF) [RFC5322]_.

  .. note::
     Should we make clients set any header fields, or reserve
     header fields for use by the recipient?)

Preparing a message for transport takes the following steps:

1. The message is fragmented into block(s).

   The block structure is as follows::

          struct {
              opaque message_id[16];
              uint16_t total_blocks;
              uint16_t block_id;
              uint32_t block_length;
              opaque block[block_length];
              opaque padding[BLOCK_LENGTH-block_length]; /* 0x00s */
          } Block;

   Where:

   * ``message_id`` - A unique identifier, consistent across all
     Block(s) belonging to a given message.

   * ``total_blocks`` - The number of Block(s) that make up the fully
     reassembled message.

   * ``block_id``     - The sequence number of the Block as a
     component of a stream of Block(s) making up
     a message, starting at ``0``.

   * ``block_length`` - The length of the Block's message fragment.
  
   * ``block``        - The Block's message fragment.

   * ``padding``      - Padding, applied to the terminal Block.

   The padding if any MUST contain ``0x00s`` (ie: be zero padded).

   The ``message_id`` SHOULD be trivially collision resistant, and
   SHOULD NOT be reused while there is a possibility that the
   recipient can end up Block(s) belonging to multiple messages
   with a colliding ``message_id``.


2. Encrypt and authenticate each block.

   Each Block is encrypted and authenticated as a Noise protocol
   [NOISE]_ handshake plus transport message, using the recipient's
   long term X25519 public key, the sender's long term X25519
   keypair, and a freshly generated ephemeral X25519 keypair.

   ``Noise_X_25519_ChaChaPoly_Blake2b`` is used as the Noise protocol
   name and parameterization for the purpose of Block encryption.

   Let the encrypted and authenticated Block be referred to as the
   following::

          struct {
              /* Noise protocol fields. */
              opaque noise_e[32];     /* The Noise handshake `e`. */
              opaque noise_s_mac[16]; /* The Noise handshake `s` MAC. */
              opaque noise_s[32];     /* The Noise handshake `s`. */
              opaque noise_mac[16];   /* The Noise ciphertext MAC. */

              opaque ciphertext[BLOCK_LENGTH];
          } BlockCiphertext;

3. Derive the path(s) and delays for each block.

   Prior to the creation of the Sphinx packet(s) that will transport
   each message, it is necessary to pre-calculate the forward and
   optional return path(s), for each BlockCiphertext and it's
   optional associated SURB-ACK.

   While the sender's provider is not, strictly speaking a "mix", it
   will apply Sphinx packet processing as if it is a mix, and
   therefore MUST have a delay.

   The recipient's provider MUST NOT have a delay.

   See :ref:`Section 5.1 <5.1>` and :ref:`Section 5.2 <5.2>` for details.

4. (Optional) Create the SURB-ACK's Single Use Reply Block for each block.
       
   To allow for reliable transmission we use acknowledgments
   encapsulated in the Single-User Reply Blocks (SURB) of the Sphinx
   packet format (see “The Sphinx Packet Format Specification”).
   We refer to these as SURB-ACKs.

   In order to create a SURB-ACK the Client uses the input obtained
   from the PKI with all the addresses and public keys of the nodes,
   where nodes include both providers and mixes.

   The new path and set of delays for each SURB-ACK are selected independently
   following Step 4.

   This SURB-ACK is included in the Sphinx packet of the forward message,
   in the payload that is received by the egress provider.

5. Assemble each BlockCiphertext and (Optional) SURBs into Sphinx
   packet payload.

   Let the Sphinx packet payload consist of the following::

          struct {
             uint8_t flags;
             uint8_t reserved; /* Set to 0x00. */
             select (flags) {
             case 0:
                 opaque padding[sizeof(SphinxSURB)];
             case 1:
                 SphinxSURB surb;
             }
             BlockCiphertext ciphertext[];
          } BlockSphinxPlaintext;

   All non-terminal hops MUST have a ``NodeDelayCommand`` and ``NextNodeHopCommand``
   command in the per-hop routing command vector.

   The terminal hop for all forward Sphinx packets MUST have a
   recipient command in the per-hop routing command vector
   containing the recipient's identifier (the local-part of the
   recipient's e-mail address).

   The terminal hop of all SURB-ACKs MUST have a recipient command
   in the per-hop command vector containing the sender's
   identifier, and additionally have a surb_reply command containing
   the ID of the SURB.

6. Send each Sphinx packet via the ``send_packet`` command.

   Each Sphinx packet is then send out via the sender's Provider
   into the mixnet, using the ``send_packet`` wire protocol command.

   The sender SHOULD impose a random delay between each packet,
   and if the sender chooses to implement this functionality such
   delay MUST be factored into the path and delay derivation done
   in step 3.

7. (Optional) Retransmit lost blocks as needed.

   If the SURB-ACK functionality is used, the sender will receive
   a SURB, containing an ACK, per block from the recipient's
   provider signalling that the Sphinx packet has arrived,
   was successfully processed, and queued for delivery to the recipient.

   As the sender specifies all mixing delays in advance, the time
   that a SURB-ACK should arrive for any given block is known to
   reasonable accuracy in advance.

   If the sender determines that a Sphinx packet was lost (for
   example by the lack of a SURB-ACK at around the expected time,
   factoring in potential additional network delays), it SHOULD
   retransmit the block. The exact ARQ strategy used to determine
   when a block is considered lost, and which blocks to retransmit
   is left up to the implementation, however the following rules
   MUST be obeyed:

   * All retransmitted blocks MUST be re-encrypted, and have a
     entirely new set of paths and delays. In simple terms, this
     means re-doing the packet creation/transmission from step 2
     for each retransmitted block.

   * Senders MUST NOT retransmit blocks at a rate faster than one
     block per 3 seconds.

   * Retransmissions must NOT have predictable timing otherwise
     it exposes the destination Provider to discovery by a
     powerful adversary that can perform active confirmation
     attacks.

   * Senders MUST NOT attempt to retransmit blocks indefinitely,
     and instead give up on the entire message after it fails to
     arrive after a certain number of retransmissions.

4.1 Provider Behavior for Receiving Messages from the Mix Network
-----------------------------------------------------------------

All Providers MUST accept inbound connections from the final layer
of the mix network, and receive Sphinx packets.  Upon receiving a
Sphinx packet, the provider MUST do the following things:

1. Unwrap the Sphinx packet.

   All unwrapped packets MUST have at least a recipient command in
   the per-hop command vector specifying which client the packet
   is destined for.

   Providers MUST discard all packets that are either missing
   recipient information, or that are addressed to unknown
   recipients with no additional processing.

2. Handle the unwrapped packet.

   Iff the Sphinx packet did not have a ``surb_reply`` command in the
   per-hop command vector, then the payload MUST be interpreted as
   a ``BlockSphinxPlaintext`` as follows:

   1. The Provider queues the packet's ciphertext field for
      later delivery to the client (via the retrieval mechanism
      specified in section 3.2).

   2. After the ciphertext has been queued into persistent
      storage, the Provider MUST generate the ack’s payload,
      concatenate with the received SURB-ACK header and
      transmit a SURB-ACK, iff the ``BlockSphinxPlaintext``'s
      flags is equal to ``1``, and a valid SURB is present in
      the payload.

      The SURB-ACK payload MUST be completely zero filled (contain
      only ``0x00`` bytes).

      Providers MUST NOT generate and transmit a SURB-ACK unless
      the ciphertext has been successfully queued for delivery.

      Iff the Sphinx packet has a ``surb_reply`` command in the per-hop
      command vector, then the entire Sphinx packet payload, along
      with the ``surb_id`` value from the ``surb_reply`` command is queued
      for later delivery to the client.

4.2 Client Receive Message Behavior
-----------------------------------

Clients periodically poll their Provider with a retreive_message
command. This section describes the client behavior upon receiving
messages from their Provider, based on type. 

4.2.1 Client Message Processing
-------------------------------

When a client receives an inbound message from their provider,
denoted as such by virtue of not being a SURB payload, the
ciphertext will contain a BlockCiphertext, that is first decrypted
as per the Noise protocol using the private component of their long
term X25519 keypair, into a Block.

It is then each client's responsibility to:

* Queue, and reassemble multi-block messages as necessary based on
  the BlockCiphertext `s` field (sender's long term public key),
  and the ``message_id``, ``total_blocks``, and ``block_id`` fields in the Block
  structure.

  When reassembling messages, the values of ``s``, ``message_id``, and
  ``total_blocks`` are fixed for any given distinct message. All
  differences in those fields across Blocks MUST be interpreted as
  the Blocks belonging to different messages.

  It is important to keep in mind that both the message and ACK
  delivery mechanisms are fundamentally unreliable, and that it is
  possible to receive blocks containing identical payload in the
  event of a spurious transmission. Clients MUST validate that such
  Blocks (overlapping ``block_id``) are in fact spurious retransmissions
  by doing a bitwise compare of the block payloads, and take
  appropriate action such as warning the user if an anomaly is
  detected.

* Present the IMF format message to the user.

  Clients MUST discard messages that fail to authenticate or decrypt,
  and MUST warn the user at a minimum, if the long term public key
  used by the sender to encrypt messages is different from a previously
  known value.

  Clients MAY impose a reasonable deadline for the reassembly process,
  after which partially received messages are discarded.

  .. note::
   
        XXX/ya: Should we mandate that clients insert something like:
        `X-Katzenpost-Sender: <Base64(s)>` as a header?


5. Sphinx Packet Composition Considerations
===========================================

Here we describe important facets of how clients construct Sphinx
packets. This section assumes the client interacts with the mix
network PKI as well as a universal time facility, the constraints
of which have been specified in detail in our PKI specification
[KATZMIXPKI]_.

.. _5.1:

5.1 Choosing Delays: for single Block messages and for multi Block messages
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Client generates a delay for the ingress provider and for each of
the mixes in the route, though not for the egress provider.  The
delays for each mix hop are drawn from the exponential distribution
independently for each node. For a class of traffic ``TRAFFIC_X``, the
parameter ``LAMBDA_X`` (also known as μ in the Loopix paper), which is
the inverse of the mean of the exponential distribution in
milliseconds, is published by the mix network PKI and the same for all
clients. Given ``LAMBDA_X``, the sender just draws a random value from
Exp(μ). The frequency of sending messages weather they be forward
messages or decoy drops, is controlled by the parameter known as
LAMBDA_P (aka λ_P) in the loopix paper [LOOPIX]_, which is the inverse
of the mean of the exponential distribution in milliseconds.

.. note::

   XXX/ya: Shouldn't this be up to the client?  The sender's provider delays
   the way this is speced out now... Design required here I think.

For multi-Block messages, the client trickles the Blocks rather
than sending them all in a burst.  This mitigates e2e correlation
attacks that look at bursts of multiple sent/received packets, and
use that information to link the sender and receiver of a
multi-Block message.

.. _5.2:

5.2 Path selection algorithm
----------------------------

The path selection algorithm is composed of four steps:

1. Sample all forward and SURB delays.

2. Ensure total delays doesn't exceed ``(time_till next_epoch) +
   2 * epoch_duration``, as keys are only published 3 epochs in
   advance.

3. Pick forward and SURB mixes (Section 5.2.1).

4. Ensure that the forward and SURB mixes have a published key that
   will allow them to decrypt the packet at the time of it's expected
   arrival.

If either step 2 or 4 fails due to lack of keying, or excessive delay,
the entire path selection process MUST be restarted from the beginning.

5.2.1 Other Path Selection Considerations
-----------------------------------------

The route contains the ingress and egress providers and a sequence
of randomly selected mixes. The sequence of mixes is chosen independently
for each Block.

Katzenpost uses the Layered topology, thus the selected path MUST
contain one and only one mix per layer, and MUST traverse all layers.
Within a layer, the mix is selected with probability proportional to
its bandwidth/capacity. Thus, if a mix has a fraction ``f`` of the total
capacity of its layer, it will be selected with probability ``f``.

6. E-mail Client Integration Considerations
===========================================

The e-mail client is a distinct component from the mix network
client because we want to avoid having to heavily modify an e-mail
client just to get it to work with our mix network. Instead we
outline an e-mail integration strategy below. The main
functionalities of a mix network client are:

1. send a message,

2. download the encrypted messages stored by the
   egress provider,

3. decrypt the messages using the private
   key (or universal private key if the client do not have a
   key, or if the sender didn't know the client's key),

4. reassemble multi-Block messages.

6.1 Message Retrieval
---------------------

A local POP service can act as the mix network client, and decrypt
the final layer of Sphinx packet encryption.  The K9-Mail and other
e-mail clients will download plaintext e-mail from this service.  In
this way we avoid having to make large code changes to existing
e-mail clients.

6.2 Message Sending
-------------------

A local SMTP proxy will perform the Sphinx encryption; the user's
e-mail client will send messages to this local proxy. This avoids
having to perform the Sphinx encryption natively in the e-mail
client.

7. Client Integration Considerations
====================================

This section specifies additional design considerations other than
the core reliability protocol design.

7.1 Message Retrieval
---------------------

The mix network client component can utilize any of the above
mentioned reliability protocol and therefore can receive:

* a single Block message
* a multi-Block message

7.2 Information available to clients
------------------------------------

Clients download Mix Descriptors from the PKI, also known as the
Mix Directory Authority service.  More details about the PKI system
and the Mix Descriptors can be found in the Katzenpost Mix Network
PKI Specification.

Clients will have the following information available to them:

* Katzenpost Mix Network Parameters via the PKI:

  * topology information,
  * packet sizes for different classes of traffic,
  * parameter of the exponential delay (lambda) for Poisson mix strategy [KESDOGAN98]_, [LOOPIX]_
  * the list of public keys and addresses of the providers,
  * the list of public keys and addresses of the active mixes,

* Mix Network Consensus Document containing Mix Descriptors as
  described in the Katzenpost Mix Network PKI Specification

* Current mix network time via Rough Time protocol with mixes

8. Anonymity Considerations
===========================

* The reliability protocol will allow for active confirmation
  attacks. [CYA2013]_ ARQ protocol schemes present predictable user
  behavior such as message retransmissions when an ACK is not
  received in time. A malicious Provider who can also block or
  delay messages destined to other Providers can get confirmation
  that a message did NOT originate from one or more Providers. That
  is, if a retransmission is received while one of the Providers
  was blocked, it is highly likely this is because the client who
  is sending the message originates from that blocked Provider. If
  the client sends enough new messages then the adversary can
  eventually perform a binary search or tree search to determine
  the originating Provider.

* Between two communicating parties at least one Provider must be
  honest to maintain send/receiver anonymity with respect to third
  party observers.

* Usage of SURBs for message ACKs present deanonymization
  vulnerability via compulsion attacks. Each SURB contains a Sphinx
  packet header which contains routing information which is
  encrypted with several mix public key. An adversary could compel
  each of these mix operators to decrypt their portion of the
  Sphinx header until the entire route in traced to it's
  destination. Future work may build some partial defences for these
  attacks. [COMPULS05]_

* There is no specified defence against n-1 attacks [TRICKLE02]_ at
  this time. In future versions we may utilize heartbeat traffic to
  detect such attacks. [HEARTBEAT03]_ However these denial of
  service attacks are not distinguishable from packet loss due to
  other causes such as network congestion. In the case of
  congestion it would be highly suboptimal to make the network
  congestion worse by sending lots of decoy traffic.

* This Provider based addressing scheme as described in [LOOPIX]_ is
  flexible enough to allow for alternate message system designs
  with different anonymity and security properties. In particular
  it should be possible to achieve strong location hiding
  properties.

9. Security Considerations
==========================

* Client endpoint public keys must be distributed in order to
  maintain confidentiality and integrity.

10. Future Work and Research
============================

* specify special features and design related to near real-time chat
  applications using a mix network transport protocol
* change the path selection algorithm to use legal jurisdictional
  region awareness for increasing the cost of compulsion attacks.
* change path selection to use a reputation system to defend
  against n-1 attacks and to increate network reliability;
  [MIRANDA]_ and [MIXRELIABLE]_
* Mitigate known active confirmation attacks?
* End to End Forward Secrecy using the Signal Double Ratchet
* make bulk transfers go faster using Selective Repeat ARQ and
  Go-Back-N ARQ
* make bulk transfers go faster using forward error correction
* make bulk transfers go faster using an alternate communications
  channel such as Tor-loops or similar decoy traffic protocol that
  uses Tor.
