This document defines the Sphinx cryptographic packet format for
decryption mix networks, and provides a parameterization based around
generic cryptographic primitives types. This document does not
introduce any new crypto, but is meant to serve as an implementation
guide.

1. Introduction
===============

   The Sphinx cryptographic packet format is a compact and provably
   secure design introduced by George Danezis and Ian Goldberg [SPHINX09]_.
   It supports a full set of security features: indistinguishable
   replies, hiding the path length and relay position, detection of
   tagging attacks and replay attacks, as well as providing
   unlinkability for each leg of the packetâ€™s journey over the
   network.

1.1 Terminology
---------------

   * ``Message`` - A variable-length sequence of octets sent anonymously
     through the network.

   * ``Packet`` - A fixed-length sequence of octets transmitted anonymously
     through the network, containing the encrypted message and metadata
     for routing.

   * ``Header`` - The packet header consisting of several components, which
     convey the information necessary to verify packet integrity and
     correctly process the packet.

   * ``Payload`` - The fixed-length portion of a packet containing an
     encrypted message or part of a message, to be delivered
     anonymously.

   * ``Group`` - A finite set of elements and a binary operation that
     satisfy the properties of closure, associativity, invertability,
     and the presence of an identity element.

   * ``Group element`` - An individual element of the group.

   * ``Group generator`` - A group element capable of generating any other
     element of the group, via repeated applications of the generator
     and the group operation.

1.2 Conventions Used in This Document
-------------------------------------

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]_.

   The "C" style Presentation Language as described in [RFC5246]_
   Section 4 is used to represent data structures, except for
   cryptographic attributes, which are specified as opaque byte
   vectors.

   ``x | y`` denotes the concatenation of x and y.

   ``x ^ y`` denotes the bitwise XOR of x and y.

   "``byte``" is an 8-bit octet.

   ``x[a:b]`` denotes the sub-vector of x where a/b denote the start/end
   byte indexes (inclusive-exclusive); a/b may be omitted to signify
   the start/end of the vector x respectively.

   ``x[y]`` denotes the y'th element of list x.

   ``x.len`` denotes the length of list x.

   ``ZEROBYTES(N)`` denotes N bytes of 0x00.

   ``RNG(N)`` denotes N bytes of cryptographic random data.

   ``LEN(N)`` denotes the length in bytes of N.

   ``CONSTANT_TIME_CMP(x, y)`` denotes a constant time comparison
   between the byte vectors x and y, returning true iff x and
   y are equal.

2. Cryptographic Primitives
===========================

   This specification uses the following cryptographic primitives as the
   foundational building blocks for Sphinx:

   * ``H(M)`` - A cryptographic hash function which takes an octet array M
     to produce a digest consisting of a ``HASH_LENGTH`` byte octet
     array. ``H(M)`` MUST be pre-image and collision resistant.

   * ``MAC(K, M)`` - A cryptographic message authentication code function
     which takes a ``M_KEY_LENGTH`` byte octet array key ``K`` and arbitrary
     length octet array message ``M`` to produce an authentication tag
     consisting of a ``MAC_LENGTH`` byte octet array.

   * ``KDF(SALT, IKM)`` - A key derivation function which takes an
     arbitrary length octet array salt ``SALT`` and an arbitrary length
     octet array initial key ``IKM``, to produce an octet array of
     arbitrary length.

   * ``S(K, IV)`` - A pseudo-random generator (stream cipher) which takes
     a ``S_KEY_LENGTH`` byte octet array key ``K`` and a ``S_IV_LENGTH`` byte
     octet array initialization vector ``IV`` to produce an octet
     array key stream of arbitrary length.

   * ``SPRP_Encrypt(K, M)/SPRP_Decrypt(K, M)`` - A strong pseudo-random
     permutation (SPRP) which takes a ``SPRP_KEY_LENGTH`` byte octet
     array key ``K`` and arbitrary length message ``M``, and produces
     the encrypted ciphertext or decrypted plaintext respectively.

     When used with the default payload authentication mechanism,
     the SPRP MUST be "fragile" in that any amount of modifications
     to ``M`` results in a large number of unpredictable changes across
     the whole message upon a ``SPRP_Encrypt()`` or ``SPRP_Decrypt()``
     operation.

   * ``EXP(X, Y)`` - An exponentiation function which takes the
     ``GROUP_ELEMENT_LENGTH`` byte octet array group elements ``X`` and ``Y``,
     and returns ``X ^^ Y`` as a ``GROUP_ELEMENT_LENGTH`` byte octet array.

     Let ``G`` denote the generator of the group, and ``EXP_KEYGEN()``
     return a ``GROUP_ELEMENT_LENGTH`` byte octet array group element
     usable as private key.

     The group defined by ``G`` and ``EXP(X, Y)`` MUST satisfy the Decision
     Diffie-Hellman problem.

   *  ``EXP_KEYGEN()`` - Returns a new "suitable" private key for ``EXP()``.

2.1 Sphinx Key Derivation Function
----------------------------------

   Sphinx Packet creation and processing uses a common Key Derivation
   Function (KDF) to derive the required MAC and symmetric cryptographic
   keys from a per-hop shared secret.

   The output of the KDF is partitioned according to the following
   structure::

        struct {
            opaque header_mac[M_KEY_LENGTH];
            opaque header_encryption[S_KEY_LENGTH];
            opaque header_encryption_iv[S_IV_LENGTH];
            opaque payload_encryption[SPRP_KEY_LENGTH]
            opaque blinding_factor[GROUP_ELEMENT_LENGTH];
        } SphinxPacketKeys;

        Sphinx_KDF( info, shared_secret ) -> packet_keys

   Inputs:  ``info``            The optional context and application
                            specific information.

            ``shared_secret``   The per-hop shared secret derived from the
                            Diffie-Hellman key exchange.

   Outputs: ``packet_keys``     The SphinxPacketKeys required to handle
                            packet creation or processing.

   The output packet_keys is calculated as follows::

      kdf_out = KDF( info, shared_secret )
      packet_keys = kdf_out[:LEN( SphinxPacketKeys )]

3. Sphinx Packet Parameters
===========================

.. _3.1:

3.1 Sphinx Parameter Constants
------------------------------

   The Sphinx Packet Format is parameterized by the implementation
   based on the application and security requirements.

   * ``AD_LENGTH`` - The constant amount of per-packet unencrypted
     additional data in bytes.

   * ``PAYLOAD_TAG_LENGTH`` - The length of the message payload
     authentication tag in bytes. This SHOULD be set to at least
     16 bytes (128 bits).

   * ``PER_HOP_RI_LENGTH`` - The length of the per-hop Routing Information
     (:ref:`Section 4.1.1 <4.1.1>`) in bytes.

   * ``NODE_ID_LENGTH`` - The node identifier length in bytes.

   * ``RECIPIENT_ID_LENGTH`` - The recipient identifier length in bytes.

   * ``SURB_ID_LENGTH`` - The Single Use Reply Block (:ref:`Section 7 <7.0>`)
     identifier length in bytes.

   * ``MAX_HOPS`` - The maximum number of hops a packet can traverse.

   * ``PAYLOAD_LENGTH`` - The per-packet message payload length in
     bytes, including a ``PAYLOAD_TAG_LENGTH`` byte authentication tag.

   * ``KDF_INFO`` - A constant opaque byte vector used as the info
     parameter to the KDF for the purpose of domain separation.

3.2 Sphinx Packet Geometry
--------------------------

   The Sphinx Packet Geometry is derived from the Sphinx Parameter
   Constants (:ref:`Section 3.1 <3.1>`). These are all derived parameters, and
   are primarily of interest to implementors.

   * ``ROUTING_INFO_LENGTH`` - The total length of the "routing information"
     Sphinx Packet Header component in bytes::

         ROUTING_INFO_LENGTH = PER_HOP_RI_LENGTH * MAX_HOPS

   * ``HEADER_LENGTH`` - The length of the Sphinx Packet Header in bytes::

         HEADER_LENGTH = AD_LENGTH + GROUP_ELEMENT_LENGTH +
                         ROUTING_INFO_LENGTH + MAC_LENGTH

   * ``PACKET_LENGTH`` - The length of the Sphinx Packet in bytes::

         PACKET_LENGTH = HEADER_LENGTH + PAYLOAD_LENGTH

4. The Sphinx Cryptographic Packet Structure
============================================

   Each Sphinx Packet consists of two parts: the Sphinx Packet Header
   and the Sphinx Packet Payload::

      struct {
          opaque header[HEADER_LENGTH];
          opaque payload[PAYLOAD_LENGTH];
      } SphinxPacket;

   * ``header`` - The packet header consists of several components,
      which convey the information necessary to verify packet integrity
      and correctly process the packet.

   * ``payload`` - The application message data.

4.1 Sphinx Packet Header
------------------------

   The Sphinx Packet Header refers to the block of data immediately
   preceding the Sphinx Packet Payload in a Sphinx Packet.

   The structure of the Sphinx Packet Header is defined as follows::

      struct {
          opaque additional_data[AD_LENGTH]; /* Unencrypted. */
          opaque group_element[GROUP_ELEMENT_LENGTH];
          opaque routing_information[ROUTING_INFO_LENGTH];
          opaque MAC[MAC_LENGTH];
      } SphinxHeader;

   * ``additional_data`` - Unencrypted per-packet Additional Data (AD)
     that is visible to every hop. The AD is authenticated on a
     per-hop basis.

     As the additional_data is sent in the clear and traverses the
     network unaltered, implementations MUST take care to ensure
     that the field cannot be used to track individual packets.

   * ``group_element`` - An element of the cyclic group, used to derive
     the per-hop key material required to authenticate and process
     the rest of the SphinxHeader and decrypt a single layer of the
     Sphinx Packet Payload encryption.

   * ``routing_information`` - A vector of per-hop routing information,
     encrypted and authenticated in a nested manner. Each element of
     the vector consists of a series of routing commands, specifying
     all of the information required to process the packet.

     The precise encoding format is specified in :ref:`Section 4.1.1 <4.1.1>`.

   * ``MAC`` - A message authentication code tag covering the
     additional_data, group_element, and routing_information.

.. _4.1.1:

4.1.1 Per-hop routing information
---------------------------------

   The routing_information component of the Sphinx Packet Header
   contains a vector of per-hop routing information. When processing a
   packet, the per hop processing is set up such that the first element
   in the vector contains the routing commands for the current hop.

   The structure of the routing information is as follows::

      struct {
          RoutingCommand routing_commands<1..2^8-1>; /* PER_HOP_RI_LENGTH bytes */
          opaque encrypted_routing_commands[ROUTING_INFO_LENGTH - PER_HOP_RI_LENGTH];
      } RoutingInformation;

   The structure of a single routing command is as follows::

      struct {
          RoutingCommandType command;
          select (RoutingCommandType) {
              case null:               NullCommand;
              case next_node_hop:      NextNodeHopCommand;
              case recipient:          RecipientCommand;
              case surb_reply:         SURBReplyCommand;
          };
      } RoutingCommand;

   The following routing commands are currently defined::

      enum {
          null(0),
          next_node_hop(1),
          recipient(2),
          surb_reply(3),

          /* Routing commands between 0 and 0x7f are reserved. */

          (255)
      } RoutingCommandType;

   The null routing command structure is as follows::

      struct {
          opaque padding<0..PER_HOP_RI_LENGTH-1>;
      } NullCommand;

   The next_node_hop command structure is as follows::

      struct {
          opaque next_hop[NODE_ID_LENGTH];
          opaque MAC[MAC_LENGTH];
      } NextNodeHopCommand;

   The recipient command structure is as follows::

      struct {
          opaque recipient[RECIPEINT_ID_LENGTH];
      } RecipientCommand;

   The surb_reply command structure is as follows::

      struct {
          opaque id[SURB_ID_LENGTH];
      } SURBReplyCommand;

   While the ``NullCommand``'s padding field is specified as opaque,
   implementations SHOULD zero fill the padding. The choice of '0x00'
   as the terminal NullCommand is deliberate to ease implementation,
   as ``ZEROBYTES(N)`` produces a valid NullCommand RoutingCommand,
   resulting in "appending zero filled padding" producing valid output.

   Implementations MUST pad the routing_commands vector so that it is
   exactly ``PER_HOP_RI_LENGTH`` bytes, by appending a terminal NullCommand
   if necessary.

   Every non-terminal hop's ``routing_commands`` MUST include a
   ``NextNodeHopCommand``.

4.2 Sphinx Packet Payload
-------------------------

   The Sphinx Packet Payload refers to the block of data immediately
   following the Sphinx Packet Header in a Sphinx Packet.

   For most purposes the structure of the Sphinx Packet Payload can be
   treated as a single contiguous byte vector of opaque data.

   Upon packet creation, the payload is repeatedly encrypted (unless it
   is a SURB Reply, see :ref:`Section 7 <7.0>`) via keys derived from the
   Diffie-Hellman key exchange between the packet's ``group_element``
   and the public key of each node in the path.

   Authentication of packet integrity is done by prepending a tag set
   to a known value to the plaintext prior to the first encrypt
   operation. By virtue of the fragile nature of the SPRP function,
   any alteration to the encrypted payload as it traverses the network
   will result in an irrecoverably corrupted plaintext when the payload
   is decrypted by the recipient.

5. Sphinx Packet Creation
=========================

   For the sake of brevity, the pseudocode for all of the operations
   will take a vector of the following PathHop structure as a
   parameter named path[] to specify the path a packet will traverse,
   along with the per-hop routing commands and per-hop public keys.

   .. code::

      struct {
          /* There is no need for a node_id here, as
             routing_commands[0].next_hop specifies that
             information for all non-terminal hops. */
          opaque public_key[GROUP_ELEMENT_LENGTH];
          RoutingCommand routing_commands<1...2^8-1>;
      } PathHop;

   It is assumed that each routing_commands vector except for the
   terminal entry contains at least a RoutingCommand consisting of
   a partially assembled NextNodeHopCommand with the ``next_hop`` element
   filled in with the identifier of the next hop.

5.1 Create a Sphinx Packet Header
---------------------------------

   Both the creation of a Sphinx Packet and the creation of a SURB
   requires the generation of a Sphinx Packet Header, so it is
   specified as a distinct operation.

   .. code::

        Sphinx_Create_Header( additional_data, path[] ) -> sphinx_header,
                                                           payload_keys


   Inputs:
            ``additional_data``   The Additional Data that is visible to
                              every node along the path in the header.

            ``path``              The vector of PathHop structures in hop
                              order, specifying the node id, public
                              key, and routing commands for each hop.

   Outputs: 
            ``sphinx_header``     The resulting Sphinx Packet Header.

            ``payload_keys``      The vector of SPRP keys used to encrypt
                              the Sphinx Packet Payload, in hop order.

   The ``Sphinx_Create_Header`` operation consists of the following steps:

    1. Derive the key material for each hop.

    .. code::

      num_hops = route.len
      route_keys = [ ]
      route_group_elements = [ ]
      priv_key = EXP_KEYGEN()

      /* Calculate the key material for the 0th hop. */
      group_element = EXP( G, priv_key )
      route_group_elements += group_element
      shared_secret = EXP( path[0].public_key, priv_key )
      route_keys += Sphinx_KDF( KDF_INFO, shared_secret )
      blinding_factor = keys[0].blinding_factor

      /* Calculate the key material for rest of the hops. */
      for i = 1; i < num_hops; ++i:
          shared_secret = EXP( path[i].public_key, priv_key )
          for j = 0; j < i; ++j:
              shared_secret = EXP( shared_secret, keys[j].blinding_factor )
          route_keys += Sphinx_KDF( KDF_INFO, shared_secret )
          group_element = EXP( group_element, keys[i-1].blinding_factor )
          route_group_elements += group_element

     At the conclusion of the derivation process:
         route_keys           - A vector of per-hop SphinxKeys.
         route_group_elements - A vector of per-hop group elements.

    2. Derive the routing_information keystream and encrypted
       padding for each hop.

    .. code::

      ri_keystream = [ ]
      ri_padding = [ ]

      for i = 0; i < num_hops; ++i:
          keystream = ZEROBYTES( ROUTING_INFO_LENGTH + PER_HOP_RI_LENGTH ) ^
                        S( route_keys[i].header_encryption,
                           route_keys[i].header_encryption_iv )
          ks_len = LEN( keystream ) - (i + 1) * PER_HOP_RI_LENGTH

          padding = keystream[ks_len:]
          if i > 0:
              prev_pad_len = LEN( ri_padding[i-1] )
              padding = padding[:prev_pad_len] ^ ri_padding[i-1] |
                  padding[prev_pad_len]

          ri_keystream += keystream[:ks_len]
          ri_padding += padding

      At the conclusion of the derivation process:
         ri_keystream - A vector of per-hop routing_information
                        encryption keystreams.
         ri_padding   - The per-hop encrypted routing_information
                        padding.

    3. Create the routing_information block.

    .. code::

      /* Start with the terminal hop, and work backwards. */
      i = num_hops - 1

      /* Encode the terminal hop's routing commands. As the
         terminal hop can never have a NextNodeHopCommand, there
         are no per-hop alterations to be made. */
      ri_fragment = path[i].routing_commands |
         ZEROBYTES( PER_HOP_RI_LENGTH - LEN( path[i].routing_commands ) )

      /* Encrypt and MAC. */
      ri_fragment ^= ri_keystream[i]
      mac = MAC( route_keys[i].header_mac, additional_data |
                     route_group_elements[i] | ri_fragment |
                     ri_padding[i-1] )
      routing_info = ri_fragment
      if num_hops < MAX_HOPS:
          pad_len = (MAX_HOPS - num_hops) * PER_HOP_RI_LENGTH
          routing_info = routing_info | ZEROBYTES( pad_len )

      /* Calculate the routing info for the rest of the hops. */
      for i = num_hops - 2; i >= 0; --i:
          cmds_to_encode = [ ]

          /* Find and finalize the NextNodeHopCommand. */
          for j = 0; j < LEN( path[i].routing_commands; j++:
              cmd = path[i].routing_commands[j]
              if cmd.command == next_node_hop:
                /* Finalize the NextNodeHopCommand. */
                cmd.MAC = mac
              cmds_to_encode = cmds_to_encode + cmd /* Append */

          /* Append a terminal NullCommand. */
          ri_fragment = cmds_to_encode |
              ZEROBYTES( PER_HOP_RI_LENGTH - LEN( cmds_to_encode ) )

          /* Encrypt and MAC */
          routing_info = ri_fragment | routing_info /* Prepend. */
          routing_info ^= ri_keystream[i]
          if i > 0:
              mac = MAC( route_keys[i].header_mac, additional_data |
                         route_group_elements[i] | routing_info |
                         ri_padding[i-1] )
          else:
              mac = MAC( route_keys[i].header_mac, additional_data |
                         route_group_elements[i] | routing_info )

      At the conclusion of the derivation process:
         routing_info - The completed routing_info block.
         mac          - The MAC for the 0th hop.

    4. Assemble the completed Sphinx Packet Header and Sphinx Packet
       Payload SPRP key vector.

    .. code::

      /* Assemble the completed Sphinx Packet Header. */
      SphinxHeader sphinx_header
      sphinx_header.additional_data = additional_data
      sphinx_header.group_element = route_group_elements[0] /* From step 1. */
      sphinx_header.routing_info = routing_info   /* From step 3. */
      sphinx_header.mac = mac                     /* From step 3. */

      /* Preserve the Sphinx Payload SPRP keys, to return to the
         caller. */
      payload_keys = [ ]
      for i = 0; i < nr_hops; ++i:
          payload_keys += route_keys[i].payload_encryption

      At the conclusion of the assembly process:
         sphinx_header - The completed sphinx_header, to be returned.
         payload_keys  - The vector of SPRP keys, to be returned.

5.2 Create a Sphinx Packet
--------------------------

   .. code::

        Sphinx_Create_Packet( additional_data, path[], payload ) -> sphinx_packet

   Inputs:
            ``additional_data``   The Additional Data that is visible to
                              every node along the path in the header.

            ``path``              The vector of PathHop structures in hop
                              order, specifying the node id, public
                              key, and routing commands for each hop.

            ``payload``           The packet payload message plaintext.

   Outputs: 
            ``sphinx_packet``     The resulting Sphinx Packet.

   The ``Sphinx_Create_Packet`` operation consists of the following steps:

    1. Create the Sphinx Packet Header and SPRP key vector.

    .. code::

        sphinx_header, payload_keys =
            Sphinx_Create_Header( additional_data, path )

    2. Prepend the authentication tag, and append padding to the payload.

    .. code::

        payload = ZERO_BYTES( PAYLOAD_TAG_LENGTH ) | payload
        payload = payload | ZERO_BYTES( PAYLOAD_LENGTH - LEN( payload ) )

    3. Encrypt the payload.

    .. code::

        for i = nr_hops - 1; i >= 0; --i:
            payload = SPRP_Encrypt( payload_keys[i], payload )

    4. Assemble the completed Sphinx Packet.

    .. code::

        SphinxPacket sphinx_packet
        sphinx_packet.header = sphinx_header
        sphinx_packet.payload = payload

6. Sphinx Packet Processing
===========================

   Mix nodes process incoming packets first by performing the
   ``Sphinx_Unwrap`` operation to authenticate and decrypt the packet, and
   if applicable prepare the packet to be forwarded to the next node.

   If ``Sphinx_Unwrap`` returns an error for any given packet, the packet
   MUST be discarded with no additional processing.

   After a packet has been unwrapped successfully, a replay detection
   tag is checked to ensure that the packet has not been seen before.
   If the packet is a replay, the packet MUST be discarded with no
   additional processing.

   The routing commands for the current hop are interpreted and
   executed, and finally the packet is forwarded to the next mix node
   over the network or presented to the application if the current
   node is the final recipient.

6.1 Sphinx_Unwrap Operation
---------------------------

   The ``Sphinx_Unwrap`` operation is the majority of the per-hop packet
   processing, handling authentication, decryption, and modifying the
   packet prior to forwarding it to the next node.

   .. code::

        Sphinx_Unwrap( routing_private_key, sphinx_packet ) -> sphinx_packet,
                                                              routing_commands,
                                                              replay_tag

   Inputs:  
            ``private_routing_key``   A group element GROUP_ELEMENT_LENGTH
                                      bytes in length, that serves as the
                                      unwrapping Mix's private key.

            ``sphinx_packet``         A Sphinx packet to unwrap.

   Outputs: 
            ``error``                 Indicating a unsuccessful unwrap
                                      operation if applicable.

            ``sphinx_packet``         The resulting Sphinx packet.

            ``routing_commands``      A vector of RoutingCommand, specifying
                                      the post unwrap actions to be taken on
                                      the packet.

            ``replay_tag``            A tag used to detect whether this
                                      packet was processed before.

   The ``Sphinx_Unwrap`` operation consists of the following steps:

    0. (Optional) Examine the Sphinx Packet Header's Additional Data.

      If the header's ``additional_data`` element contains information
      required to complete the unwrap operation, such as specifying
      the packet format version or the cryptographic primitives used
      examine it now.

      Implementations MUST NOT treat the information in the
      ``additional_data`` element as trusted until after the completion
      of Step 3 ("Validate the Sphinx Packet Header").

    1. Calculate the hop's shared secret, and replay_tag.

    .. code::

        hdr = sphinx_packet.header
        shared_secret = EXP( hdr.group_element, private_routing_key )
        replay_tag = H( shared_secret )

    2. Derive the various keys required for packet processing.

    .. code::

        keys = Sphinx_KDF( KDF_INFO, shared_secret )

    3. Validate the Sphinx Packet Header.

    .. code::

        derived_mac = MAC( keys.header_mac, hdr.additional_data |
                          hdr.group_element |
                          hdr.routing_information )
        if !CONSTANT_TIME_CMP( derived_mac, hdr.MAC):
            /* MUST abort processing if the header is invalid. */
            return ErrorInvalidHeader

    4. Extract the per-hop routing commands for the current hop.

    .. code::

        /* Append padding to preserve length-invariance, as the routing
            commands for the current hop will be removed. */
        padding = ZEROBYTES( PER_HOP_RI_LENGTH )
        B = hdr.routing_information | padding

        /* Decrypt the entire routing_information block. */
        B = B ^ S( keys.header_encryption, keys.header_encryption_iv )

    5. Parse the per-hop routing commands.

    .. code::

        cmd_buf = B[:PER_HOP_RI_LENGTH]
        new_routing_information = B[PER_HOP_RI_LENGTH:]

        next_mix_command_idx = -1
        routing_commands = [ ]
        for idx = 0; idx < PER_HOP_RI_LENGTH {
             /* WARNING: Bounds checking omitted for brevity. */
             cmd_type = b[idx]
             cmd = NULL
             switch cmd_type {
                case null: goto done  /* No further commands. */

                case next_node_hop:
                    cmd = RoutingCommand( B[idx:idx+1+LEN( NextNodeHopCommand )] )
                    next_mix_command_idx = i /* Save for step 7. */
                    idx += 1 + LEN( NextNodeHopCommand )
                    break

                case recipient:
                    cmd = RoutingCommand( B[idx:idx+1+LEN( FinalDestinationCommand )] )
                    idx += 1 + LEN( RecipientCommand )
                    break

                case surb_reply:
                    cmd = RoutingCommand( B[idx:idx+1+LEN( SURBReplyCommand )] )
                    idx += 1 + LEN( SURBReplyCommand )
                    break

              default:
                    /* MUST abort processing on unrecognized commands. */
                    return ErrorInvalidCommand
            }
            routing_commands += cmd /* Append cmd to the tail of the list. */
        }
        done:

    At the conclusion of the parsing step:
         ``routing_commands``        - A vector of SphinxRoutingCommand, to be
                                   applied at this hop.
         ``new_routing_information`` - The routing_information block to be sent
                                   to the next hop if any.

    6. Decrypt the Sphinx Packet Payload.

    .. code::

        payload = sphinx_packet.payload
        payload = SPRP_Decrypt( key.payload_encryption, payload )
        sphinx_packet.payload = payload

    7. Transform the packet for forwarding to the next mix, iff the
       routing commands vector included a NextNodeHopCommand.

    .. code::

        if next_mix_command_idx != -1:
            cmd = routing_commands[next_mix_command_idx]
            hdr.group_element = EXP( hdr.group_element, keys.blinding_factor )
            hdr.routing_information = new_routing_information
            hdr.mac = cmd.MAC
            sphinx_packet.hdr = hdr

6.2 Post Sphinx_Unwrap Processing
---------------------------------

   Upon the completion of the ``Sphinx_Unwrap`` operation, implementations
   MUST take several additional steps. As the exact behavior is mostly
   implementation specific, pseudocode will not be provided for most of
   the post processing steps.

    1. Apply replay detection to the packet.

       The ``replay_tag`` value returned by Sphinx_Unwrap MUST be unique
       across all packets processed with a given ``private_routing_key``.

       The exact specifics of how to detect replays is left up to the
       implementation, however any replays that are detected MUST
       be discarded immediately.

    2. Act on the routing commands, if any.

       The exact specifics of how implementations chose to apply
       routing commands is deliberately left unspecified, however in
       general:

        * Iff there is a ``NextNodeHopCommand``, the packet should be
          forwarded to the next node based on the ``next_hop`` field
          upon completion of the post processing.

          The lack of a NextNodeHopCommand indicates that the packet
          is destined for the current node.

        * Iff there is a ``SURBReplyCommand``, the packet should be
          treated as a SURBReply destined for the current node,
          and decrypted accordingly (See :ref:`Section 7.2 <7.2>`).

        * If the implementation supports multiple recipients on a
          single node, the ``RecipientCommand`` command should be used
          to determine the correct recipient for the packet, and
          the payload delivered as appropriate.

          Note: It is possible for both a RecipientCommand and a
          NextNodeHopCommand to be present simultaneously in the
          routing commands for a given hop. The behavior when
          this situation occurs is implementation defined.

    3. Authenticate the packet if required.

       Iff the packet is destined for the current node, the integrity
       of the payload MUST be authenticated.

       The authentication is done as follows::

          derived_tag = sphinx_packet.payload[:PAYLOAD_TAG_LENGTH]
          expected_tag = ZEROBYTES( PAYLOAD_TAG_LENGTH )
          if !CONSTANT_TIME_CMP( derived_tag, expected_tag ):
              /* Discard the packet with no further processing. */
              return ErrorInvalidPayload

          /* Remove the authentication tag before presenting the
             payload to the application. */
          sphinx_packet.payload = sphinx_packet.payload[PAYLOAD_TAG_LENGTH:]

.. _7.0:

7. Single Use Reply Block (SURB) Creation
=========================================

   A Single Use Reply Block (SURB) is a delivery token with a short
   lifetime, that can be used by the recipient to reply to the initial
   sender.

   SURBs allow for anonymous replies, when the recipient does not know
   the sender of the message. Usage of SURBs guarantees anonymity
   properties but also makes the reply messages indistinguishable
   from forward messages both to external adversaries as well as the
   mix nodes.

   When a SURB is created, a matching reply block Decryption Token
   is created, which is used to decrypt the reply message that is
   produced and delivered via the SURB.

   The Sphinx SURB wire encoding is implementation defined, but for
   the purposes of illustrating creation and use, the following will
   be used::

      struct {
          SphinxHeader sphinx_header;
          opaque first_hop[NODE_ID_LENGTH];
          opaque payload_key[SPRP_KEY_LENGTH];
      } SphinxSURB;

7.1 Create a Sphinx SURB and Decryption Token
---------------------------------------------

   Structurally a SURB consists of three parts, a pre-generated Sphinx
   Packet Header, a node identifier for the first hop to use when using
   the SURB to reply, and cryptographic keying material by which to
   encrypt the reply's payload. All elements must be securely
   transmitted to the recipient, perhaps as part of a forward Sphinx
   Packet's Payload, but the exact specifics on how to accomplish this
   is left up to the implementation.

   When creating a SURB, the terminal routing_commands vector SHOULD
   include a SURBReplyCommand, containing an identifier to ensure
   that the payload can be decrypted with the correct set of keys
   (Decryption Token). The routing command is left optional, as
   it is conceivable that implementations may chose to use trial
   decryption, and or limit the number of outstanding SURBs to solve
   this problem.

   .. code::

        Sphinx_Create_SURB( additional_data, first_hop, path[] ) ->
                                                         sphinx_surb,
                                                         decryption_token

   Inputs:  
            ``additional_data``   The Additional Data that is visible to
                              every node along the path in the header.

            ``first_hop``         The node id of the first hop the
                              recipient must use when replying via the
                              SURB.

            ``path``              The vector of PathHop structures in hop
                              order, specifying the node id, public
                              key, and routing commands for each hop.

   Outputs:
            ``sphinx_surb``       The resulting Sphinx SURB.

            ``decryption_token``  The Decryption Token associated with
                              the SURB.

   The Sphinx_Create_SURB operation consists of the following steps:

    1. Create the Sphinx Packet Header and SPRP key vector.

    .. code::

        sphinx_header, payload_keys =
              Sphinx_Create_Header( additional_data, path )

    2. Create a key for the final layer of encryption.

    .. code::

        final_key = RNG( SPRP_KEY_LENGTH )

    3. Build the SURB and Decryption Token.

    .. code::

        SphinxSURB sphinx_surb;
        sphinx_surb.sphinx_header = sphinx_header
        sphinx_surb.first_hop = first_hop
        sphinx_surb.payload_key = final_key

        decryption_token = final_key + payload_keys /* Prepend */

.. _7.2:

7.2 Decrypt a Sphinx Reply Originating from a SURB
--------------------------------------------------

   A Sphinx Reply packet that was generated using a SURB is externally
   indistinguishable from a forward Sphinx Packet as it traverses the
   network. However, the recipient of the reply has an additional
   decryption step, the packet starts off unencrypted, and accumulates
   layers of Sphinx Packet Payload decryption as it traverses the
   network.

   Determining which decryption token to use when decrypting the SURB
   reply can be done via the SURBReplyCommand's id field, if one is
   included at the time of the SURB's creation.

   .. code::

        Sphinx_Decrypt_SURB_Reply( decryption_token, payload ) -> message

   Inputs: 
          ``decryption_token``   The vector of keys allowing a client to
                              decrypt the reply ciphertext payload. This
                              decryption_token is generated when the
                              SURB is created.

           ``payload``            The Sphinx Packet ciphertext payload.

   Outputs: 
            ``error``             Indicating a unsuccessful unwrap
                              operation if applicable.

            ``message``           The plaintext message.

   The Sphinx_Decrypt_SURB_Reply operation consists of the following
   steps:

    1. Encrypt the message to reverse the decrypt operations the
       payload acquired as it traversed the network.

    .. code::

      for i = LEN( decryption_token ) - 1; i > 0; --i:
          payload = SPRP_Encrypt( decryption_token[i], payload )

    2. Decrypt and authenticate the message ciphertext.

    .. code::

      message = SPRP_Decrypt( decryption_token[0], payload )

      derived_tag = message[:PAYLOAD_TAG_LENGTH]
      expected_tag = ZEROBYTES( PAYLOAD_TAG_LENGTH )
      if !CONSTANT_TIME_CMP( derived_tag, expected_tag ):
          return ErrorInvalidPayload

      message = message[PAYLOAD_TAG_LENGTH:]

8. Single Use Reply Block Replies
=================================

   The process for using a SURB to reply anonymously is slightly
   different from the standard packet creation process, as the
   Sphinx Packet Header is already generated (as part of the SURB),
   and there is an additional layer of Sphinx Packet Payload
   encryption that must be performed.

   .. code::

        Sphinx_Create_SURB_Reply( sphinx_surb, payload ) -> sphinx_packet

   Inputs:  
            ``sphinx_surb``       The SphinxSURB structure, decoded from
                              the implementation defined wire encoding.

            ``payload``           The packet payload message plaintext.

   The Sphinx_Create_SURB_Reply operation consists of the following
   steps:

    1. Prepend the authentication tag, and append padding to the payload.

    .. code::

      payload = ZERO_BYTES( PAYLOAD_TAG_LENGTH ) | payload
      payload = payload | ZERO_BYTES( PAYLOAD_LENGTH - LEN( payload ) )

    2. Encrypt the payload.

    .. code::

      payload = SPRP_Encrypt( sphinx_surb.payload_key, payload )

    3. Assemble the completed Sphinx Packet.

    .. code::

      SphinxPacket sphinx_packet
      sphinx_packet.header = sphinx_surb.sphinx_header
      sphinx_packet.payload = payload

   The completed ``sphinx_packet`` MUST be sent to the node specified via
   ``sphinx_surb.node_id``, as the entire reply ``sphinx_packet``'s header is
   pre-generated.

9. Anonymity Considerations
===========================

9.1 Optional Non-constant Length Sphinx Packet Header Padding
-------------------------------------------------------------

   Depending on the mix topology, there is no hard requirement that the
   per-hop routing info is padded to one fixed constant length.

   For example, assuming a layered topology (referred to as stratified
   topology in the literature) [MIXTOPO10]_, where the layer of any given
   mix node is public information, as long as the following two
   invariants are maintained, there is no additional information
   available to an adversary:

       1. All packets entering any given mix node in a certain layer are
          uniform in length.

       2. All packets leaving any given mix node in a certain layer are
          uniform in length.

   The only information available to an external or internal observer is
   the layer of any given mix node (via the packet length), which is
   information they are assumed to have by default in such a design.

9.2 Additional Data Field Considerations
----------------------------------------

   The Sphinx Packet Construct is crafted such that any given packet
   is bitwise unlinkable after a Sphinx_Unwrap operation, provided
   that the optional Additional Data (AD) facility is not used. This
   property ensures that external passive adversaries are unable to
   track a packet based on content as it traverses the network. As
   the on-the-wire AD field is static through the lifetime of a
   packet (ie: left unaltered by the ``Sphinx_Unwrap`` operation),
   implementations and applications that wish to use this facility
   MUST NOT transmit AD that can be used to distinctly identify
   individual packets.

9.3 Forward Secrecy Considerations
----------------------------------

   Each node acting as a mix MUST regenerate their asymmetric key pair
   relatively frequently. Upon key rotation the old private key MUST
   be securely destroyed. As each layer of a Sphinx Packet is encrypted
   via key material derived from the output of an ephemeral/static
   Diffie-Hellman key exchange, without the rotation, the construct
   does not provide Perfect Forward Secrecy. Implementations SHOULD
   implement defense-in-depth mitigations, for example by using
   strongly forward-secure link protocols to convey Sphinx Packets
   between nodes.

   This frequent mix routing key rotation can limit SURB usage by
   directly reducing the lifetime of SURBs. In order to have a strong
   Forward Secrecy property while maintaining a higher SURB lifetime,
   designs such as forward secure mixes [SFMIX03]_ could be used.

9.4 Compulsion Threat Considerations
------------------------------------

   Reply Blocks (SURBs), forward and reply Sphinx packets are all
   vulnerable to the compulsion threat, if they are captured by an
   adversary. The adversary can request iterative decryptions or keys
   from a series of honest mixes in order to perform a deanonymizing
   trace of the destination.

   While a general solution to this class of attacks is beyond the
   scope of this document, applications that seek to mitigate or
   resist compulsion threats could implement the defenses proposed
   in [COMPULS05]_ via a series of routing command extensions.

9.5 SURB Usage Considerations for Volunteer Operated Mix Networks
-----------------------------------------------------------------

   Given a hypothetical scenario where Alice and Bob both wish to keep
   their location on the mix network hidden from the other, and Alice
   has somehow received a SURB from Bob, Alice MUST not utilize the
   SURB directly because in the volunteer operated mix network the
   first hop specified by the SURB could be operated by Bob for the
   purpose of deanonymizing Alice.

   This problem could be solved via the incorporation of a "cross-over
   point" such as that described in [MIXMINION]_, for example by
   having Alice delegating the transmission of a SURB Reply to a
   randomly selected crossover point in the mix network, so that
   if the first hop in the SURB's return path is a malicious mix,
   the only information gained is the identity of the cross-over
   point.

10. Security Considerations
===========================

10.1 Sphinx Payload Encryption Considerations
---------------------------------------------

   The payload encryption's use of a fragile (non-malleable) SPRP is
   deliberate and implementations SHOULD NOT substitute it with a
   primitive that does not provide such a property (such as a stream
   cipher based PRF). In particular there is a class of correlation
   attacks (tagging attacks) targeting anonymity systems that involve
   modification to the ciphertext that are mitigated if alterations
   to the ciphertext result in unpredictable corruption of the
   plaintext (avalanche effect).

   Additionally, as the PAYLOAD_TAG_LENGTH based tag-then-encrypt
   payload integrity authentication mechanism is predicated on the
   use of a non-malleable SPRP, implementations that substitute a
   different primitive MUST authenticate the payload using a
   different mechanism.

   Alternatively, extending the MAC contained in the Sphinx Packet
   Header to cover the Sphinx Packet Payload will both defend against
   tagging attacks and authenticate payload integrity. However, such an
   extension does not work with the SURB construct presented in this
   specification, unless the SURB is only used to transmit payload
   that is known to the creator of the SURB.
