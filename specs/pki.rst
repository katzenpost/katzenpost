.. rubric:: Abstract

   This document describes the message formats and protocols of a
   decryption mix network public key infrastructure system. It has some
   specific design features which aid in traffic analysis resistance.
   This document is meant to serve as an implementation guide.

1. Introduction
===============

   Mixnets are designed with the assumption that a PKI exists and it
   gives each client the same view of the network. This specification
   is inspired by the Tor and Mixminion Directory Authority systems
   [MIXMINIONDIRAUTH]_ [TORDIRAUTH]_ whose main features are precisely what
   we need in our PKI. These are decentralized systems meant to be
   collectively operated by multiple entities.

   The mix network directory authority system (PKI) is essentially a
   cooperative decentralized database and voting system that is used
   to produce network consensus documents which mix clients
   periodically retrieve and use for their path selection algorithm
   when creating Sphinx packets. These network consensus documents are
   derived from a voting process between the Directory Authority
   servers.

   This design prevents mix clients from using only a partial view of
   the network for their path selection so as to avoid fingerprinting
   and bridging attacks [FINGERPRINTING]_ [BRIDGING]_ [LOCALVIEW]_.

   The PKI is also used by Authority operators to specify network-wide
   parameters, for example in the Katzenpost Decryption Mix Network
   [KATZMIXNET]_ the Poisson mix strategy is used and therefore all the
   clients must use the same lambda parameter for their exponential
   distribution function when choosing hop delays in the path
   selection. The Mix Network Directory Authority system aka PKI
   SHALL be used to distribute such network-wide parameters in the network
   consensus document that have an impact on security and performance.

1.1 Conventions Used in This Document
-------------------------------------

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]_.

   The "C" style Presentation Language as described in [RFC5246]_
   Section 4 is used to represent data structures for additional
   cryptographic wire protocol commands. [KATZMIXWIRE]_

1.2 Terminology
---------------

   ``PKI`` - public key infrastructure

   ``Directory Authority system`` - refers to specific PKI schemes used by
                                Mixminion and Tor

   ``MSL`` - maximum segment lifetime

   ``mix descriptor`` - A database record which describes a component mix

   ``family`` - Identifier of security domains or entities operating one
            or more mixes in the network. This is used to inform the
            path selection algorithm.

   ``nickname`` - simply a nickname string that is unique in the consensus
              document; see "Katzenpost Mix Network Specification"
              section "2.2. Network Topology".

   ``layer`` - The layer indicates which network topology layer a
           particular mix resides in.

   ``Provider`` - A service operated by a third party that Clients
              communicate directly with to communicate with the Mixnet.
              It is responsible for Client authentication,
              forwarding outgoing messages to the Mixnet, and storing incoming
              messages for the Client. The Provider MUST have the ability to
              perform cryptographic operations on the relayed messages.

1.3 Security Properties Overview
--------------------------------

   This Directory Authority system has the following feature goals and
   security properties:

      * All Directory Authority servers must agree with each other on
        the set of Directory Authorities.

      * All Directory Authority servers must agree with each other on
        the set of mixes.

      * This system is intentionally designed to provide identical
        network consensus documents to each mix client. This mitigates
        epistemic attacks against the client path selection algorithm
        such as fingerprinting and bridge attacks [FINGERPRINTING]_
        [BRIDGING]_.

      * This system is NOT byzantine-fault-tolerant, it instead allows
        for manual intervention upon consensus fault by the Directory
        Authority operators. Further, these operators are responsible
        for expelling bad acting operators from the system.

      * This system enforces the network policies such as mix join
        policy wherein intentionally closed mixnets will prevent
        arbitrary hosts from joining the network by authenticating all
        descriptor signatures with a list of allowed public keys.

      * The Directory Authority system for a given mix network is
        essentially the root of all authority.

1.4 Differences from Tor and Mixminion Directory Authority systems
----------------------------------------------------------------------

   In this document we specify a Directory Authority system
   which is different from that of Tor's and Mixminion's in a number
   of ways:

      * The list of valid mixes is expressed in a white list. For
        the time being there is no specified "bandwidth authority"
        system which verifies the health of mixes.
        (Further research required.)

      * There's no non-directory channel to inform clients that a node
        is down, so it will end up being a lot of packet loss, since
        clients will continue to include the missing node in their
        path selection till keys published by the node expire and it
        falls out of the consensus.

      * The schema of the mix descriptors is different from that used
        in Mixminion and Tor, including a change which allows our mix
        descriptor to express n Sphinx mix routing public keys in a
        single mix descriptor whereas in the Tor and Mixminion Directory
        Authority systems, n descriptors are used.

      * The serialization format of mix descriptors is different from
        that used in Mixminion and Tor.

      * The shared random number computation is performed every voting round,
        and is required for a vote to be accepted by each authority. The shared
        random number is used to deterministically generate the network
        topology.

.. note::

   David: add more differences to this list

2. Overview of Mix PKI Interaction
==================================

   Each Mix MUST rotate the key pair used for Sphinx packet processing
   periodically for forward secrecy reasons and to keep the list of
   seen packet tags short. [SPHINX09]_ [SPHINXSPEC]_ The Katzenpost Mix
   Network uses a fixed interval (``epoch``), so that key rotations happen
   simultaneously throughout the network, at predictable times.

   Each Directory Authority server MUST use some time synchronization
   protocol in order to correctly use this protocol. This Directory
   Authority system requires time synchronization to within a few
   minutes.

   Let each epoch be exactly ``10800 seconds (3 hours)`` in duration, and
   the 0th Epoch begin at ``2017-06-01 00:00 UTC``.

   To facilitate smooth operation of the network and to allow for
   delays that span across epoch boundaries, Mixes MUST publish keys
   to the PKI for at least 3 epochs in advance, unless the mix will
   be otherwise unavailable in the near future due to planned downtime.

   Thus, at any time, keys for all Mixes for the Nth through N + 2nd
   epoch will be available, allowing for a maximum round trip (forward
   message + SURB) delay + transit time of 6 hours. SURB lifetime is
   limited to a few hours because of the key rotation epoch, however
   this shouldn't present any useability problems since SURBs are only
   used for sending ACK messages from the destination Provider to the
   sender as described in [KATZMIXE2E]_.

2.1 PKI Protocol Schedule
-------------------------

   There are two main constraints to Authority schedule:

   1. There MUST be enough key material extending into the
   future so that clients are able to construct Sphinx packets with a
   forward and reply paths.

   2. All participants should have enough time to participate in the
   protocol; upload descriptors, vote, generate documents, download
   documents, establish connections for user traffic.

   The epoch duration of 3 hours is more than adequate for these two
   constraints.

   .. note::
   
        XXX david: perhaps we should make it shorter? but first let's do
        some scaling and bandwidth calculations to see how bad it gets...

2.1.1 Directory Authority Server Schedule
-----------------------------------------

   Directory Authority server interactions are conducted according to
   the following schedule, where ``T`` is the beginning of the current epoch,
   and ``P`` is the length of the epoch period.

   ``T``                         - Epoch begins

   ``T + P/2``                   - Vote exchange

   ``T + (5/8)*P``               - Reveal exchange

   ``T + (6/8)*P``               - Tabulation and signature exchange

   ``T + (7/8)*P``               - Publish consensus


2.1.2 Mix Schedule
------------------

   Mix PKI interactions are conducted according to the following
   schedule, where T is the beginning of the current epoch.

    ``T + P/2``            - Deadline for publication of all mixes documents
                               for the next epoch.

    ``T + (7/8)*P``        - This marks the beginning of the period
                               where mixes perform staggered fetches
                               of the PKI consensus document.

    ``T + (8/9)*P``        - Start establishing connections to the new set of
                               relevant mixes in advance of the next epoch.

    ``T + P - 1MSL``       - Start accepting new Sphinx packets encrypted to
                               the next epoch's keys.

    ``T + P + 1MSL``       - Stop accepting new Sphinx packets encrypted to
                               the previous epoch's keys, close connections to
                               peers no longer listed in the PKI documents and
                               erase the list of seen packet tags.

   As it stands, mixes have ~1.5 hours to publish, the PKI has ~1 hour 
   to vote, and the mixes have 20 mins to establish connections before
   there is network connectivity failure.

   Mix layer changes are controlled by the Directory Authorities and
   therefore a mix can be reassigned to a different layer in our
   stratified topology at any new epoch. Mixes will maintain incoming
   and outgoing connections to the various nodes until all mix keys
   have expired, iff the node is still listed anywhere in the current
   document.

3. Voting for Consensus Protocol
================================

   In our Directory Authority protocol, all the actors conduct their
   behavior according to a common schedule as outlined in section "2.1
   PKI Protocol Schedule". The Directory Authority servers exchange
   messages to reach consensus about the network. Other tasks they
   perform include collecting mix descriptor uploads from each mix for
   each key rotation epoch, voting, shared random number generation,
   signature exchange and publishing of the network consensus documents.

3.1 Protocol Messages
---------------------

   There are only two document types in this protocol:

   * ``mix_descriptor``: A mix descriptor describes a mix.

   * ``directory``: A directory contains a list of descriptors and other
     information that describe the mix network.

   Mix descriptor and directory documents MUST be properly signed.

3.1.1 Mix Descriptor and Directory Signing
------------------------------------------

   Mixes MUST compose mix descriptors which are signed using their
   private identity key, an ed25519 key. Directories are signed by one
   or more Directory Authority servers using their authority key, also
   an ed25519 key. In all cases, signing is done using JWS [RFC7515]_.

3.2 Vote Exchange
-----------------

   As described in section "2.1 PKI Protocol Schedule", the Directory
   Authority servers begin the voting process 2 hours after epoch
   beginning.  Each Authority exchanges vote directory messages with
   each other.

   Authorities archive votes from other authorities and make them
   available for retreival. Upon receiving a new vote, the authority
   examines it for new descriptors and includes any valid descriptors
   in its view of the network.

   Each Authority includes in its vote a hashed value committing to a choice of
   a random number for the vote. See section 4.3 for more details.

3.2.1 Voting Wire Protocol Commands

   The Katzenpost Wire Protocol as described in [KATZMIXWIRE] is used
   by Authorities to exchange votes. We define additional wire
   protocol commands for sending votes:

      enum {
         vote(22),
         vote_status(23),
      } Command;

   The structures of these commands are defined as follows:

      struct {
          uint64_t epoch_number;
          opaque public_key[ED25519_KEY_LENGTH];
          opaque payload[];
      } VoteCommand;

      struct {
         uint8 error_code;
      } VoteStatusCommand;

3.2.2 The vote Command

   The get_consensus command is used to send a PKI document to a peer
   Authority during the voting period of the PKI schedule.

   The payload field contains the signed and serialized PKI document
   representing the sending Authority's vote. The public_key field
   contains the public identity key of the sending Authority which the
   receiving Authority can use to verify the signature of the payload.
   The epoch_number field is used by the receiving party to quickly
   check the epoch for the vote before deserializing the payload.

   Each authority MUST include its commit value for the
   shared random computation in this phase along with its signed vote.
   This computation is derived from the Tor Shared Random Subsystem,
   [TORSRV].

3.2.3 The vote_status Command

   The vote_status command is used to reply to a vote command. The
   error_code field indicates if there was a failure in the receiving
   of the PKI document.

      enum {
         vote_ok(0),          /* None error condition. */
         vote_too_early(1),   /* The Authority should try again later. */
         vote_too_late(2),    /* This round of voting was missed. */
      }

   The epoch_number field of the vote struct is compared with the
   epoch that is currently being voted on. vote_too_early and
   vote_too_late are replied back to the voter to report that their
   vote was not accepted.

3.3 Reveal Exchange
-------------------
   As described in section "2.1 PKI Protocol Schedule", the Directory
   Authority servers exchange the reveal values after they have exchanged
   votes which contain a commit value. Each Authority exchanges reveal
   messages with each other.

3.3.1 Reveal Wire Protocol Commands

   The Katzenpost Wire Protocol as described in [KATZMIXWIRE] is used by Authorities to exchange reveal values previously commited to in their votes. We define additional wire protocol commands for exchanging reveals:

   enum {
      reveal(25),
      reveal_status(26),
   } Command;

   The structures of these commands are defined as follows:

      struct {
          uint64_t epoch_number;
          opaque public_key[ED25519_KEY_LENGTH];
          opaque payload[];
      } RevealCommand;

      struct {
         uint8 error_code;
      } RevealStatusCommand;

3.3.2 The reveal Command

   The reveal command is used to send a reveal value to a peer authority during
   the reveal period of the PKI schedule.

   The payload field contains the signed and serialized reveal value.  The
   public_key field contains the public identity key o fthe sending Authority
   which the receiving Authority can use to verify the signature of the
   payload. The epoch_number field is used by the receiving party to quickly
   check the epoch for the reveal before deserializing the payload.

3.3.3 The reveal_status Command

   The reveal_status command is used to reply to a reveal command. The
   error_code field indicates if there was a failure in the receiving of
   the shared random reveal value.

   enum {
      reveal_ok(8),                /* None error condition. */
      reveal_too_early(9),         /* The Authority should try again later. */
      reveal_not_authorized(10),   /* The Authority was rejected. */
      reveal_already_received(11), /* The Authority has already revealed this round. */
      reveal_too_late(12)          /* This round of revealing was missed. */
   } Errorcodes;

   The epoch_number field of the reveal struct is compared with the epoch
   that is currently being voted on. reveal_too_early and reveal_too_late
   are replied back to the autohrity to report their reveal was not
   accepted. The status code reveal_not_authorized is used if the
   Authority is rejected. The reveal_already_received is used to
   report that a valid reveal command was already received for this
   round.

3.4 Vote Tabulation for Consensus Computation
---------------------------------------------

   The main design constraint of the vote tabulation algorithm is that
   it MUST be a deterministic process that produces the same result
   for each directory authority server. This result is known as a
   network consensus file.

   A network consensus file is a well formed directory struct where
   the ``status`` field is set to ``consensus`` and contains 0 or more
   descriptors, the mix directory is signed by 0 or more directory
   authority servers. If signed by the full voting group then this is
   called a fully signed consensus.

   1. Validate each vote directory:
      - that the liveness fields correspond to the following epoch
      - status is ``vote``
      - version number matches ours

   2. Compute a consensus directory:

      Here we include a modified section from the Mixminion PKI spec
      [MIXMINIONDIRAUTH]_:

      - For each distinct mix identity in any vote directory:
            - If there are multiple nicknames for a given identity, do not
              include any descriptors for that identity.
            - If half or fewer of the votes include the identity, do not
              include any descriptors for the identity.  [This also
              guarantees that there will be only one identity per nickname.]
            - If we are including the identity, then for each distinct
              descriptor that appears in any vote directory:

                - Do not include the descriptor if it will have expired
                  on the date the directory will be published.
                - Do not include the descriptor if it is superseded by
                  other descriptors for this identity.
                - Do not include the descriptor if it not valid in the
                  next epoch.
                - Otherwise, include the descriptor.

      - Sort the list of descriptors by the signature field so that
        creation of the consensus is reproducible.
      - Set directory ``status`` field to ``consensus``.

   3. Compute a shared random number from the values revealed in the "Reveal"
         step. Authorities whose reveal value does not verify their commit
         value MUST be excluded from the consensus round.

   4. Generate or update the network topology using the shared random number as
         a seed to a deterministic random number generator that determines the
         order that new mixes are placed into the topology.

3.4 Signature Collection
------------------------

   Each Authority exchanges their newly generated consensus files with
   each other. Upon receiving signed consensus documents from the
   other Authorities, peer signatures are appended to the current
   local consensus file if the signed contents match. The Authority
   SHOULD warn the administrator if network partition is detected.

   If there is disagreement about the consensus directory, each
   authority collects signatures from only the servers which it agrees
   with about the final consensus.

   // TODO: consider exchanging peers votes amongst authorities (or hashes thereof) to
   // ensure that an authority has distributed one and only unique vote amongst its peers.

3.5 Publication
---------------

   If the consensus is signed by a majority of members of the voting
   group then it's a valid consensus and it is published.

4. PKI Protocol Data Structures
===============================

4.1 Mix Descriptor Format
-------------------------

   Note that there is no signature field. This is because mix
   descriptors are serialized and signed using JWS. The
   ``IdentityKey`` field is a public ed25519 key.  The ``MixKeys`` field
   is a map from epoch to public X25519 keys which is what the Sphinx
   packet format uses.

.. note::

    XXX David: replace the following example
    with a JWS example:

.. code::

   {
       "Version": 0,
       "Name": "",
       "Family": "",
       "Email": "",
       "AltContactInfo":"",
       "IdentityKey": "",
       "LinkKey":"",
       "MixKeys": {
          "Epoch": "EpochPubKey",
       },
       "Addresses": ["IP:Port"],
       "Layer": 0,
       "LoadWeight":0
   }

4.1.1 Scheduling Mix Downtime
-----------------------------

   Mix operators can publish a half empty mix descriptor for future
   epochs to schedule downtime. The mix descriptor fields that MUST
   be populated are:

   * Version
   * Name
   * Family
   * Email
   * Layer
   * IdentityKey
   * MixKeys

   The map in the field called "MixKeys" should reflect the scheduled
   downtown for one or more epochs by not have those epochs as keys in
   the map.

4.2 Directory Format
--------------------

.. note::

   replace the following example with a JWS example

.. code::

   {
       "Signatures": [],
       "Version": 0,
       "Status": "vote",
       "Lambda" : 0.274,
       "MaxDelay" : 30,
       "Topology" : [],
       "Providers" : [],
   }

4.3 Shared Random Value structure
---------------------------------

Katzenpost's Shared Random Value computation is inspired by Tor's Shared Random Subsystem [TORSRV].

Each voting round a commit value is included in the votes sent to other authorities. These are produced as follows:
   H = SHA3-256

   COMMIT = Uint64(epoch) | H(REVEAL)
   REVEAL = Uint64(epoch) | H(RN)

After the votes are collected from the voting round, and before signature exchange, the Shared Random Value field of the consensus document is the output of H over the input string calculated as follows:

  1. Validated Reveal commands received including the authorities own reveal
       are sorted by reveal value in ascending order and appended to the input
       in format IdentityPublicKeyBytes_n | RevealValue_n

  2. If a SharedRandomValue for the previous epoch exists, it is appended to
       the input string, otherwise 32 NUL (\x00) bytes are used.

  REVEALS = ID_a | R_a | ID_b | R_b | ...
  SharedRandomValue = H("shared-random" | Uint64(epoch) | REVEALS | PREVIOUS_SRV)

5. PKI Wire Protocol
====================

   The Katzenpost Wire Protocol as described in [KATZMIXWIRE]_ is used
   by both clients and by Directory Authority peers. In the following
   section we describe additional wire protocol commands for publishing
   mix descriptors, voting and consensus retrieval.

5.1 Mix Descriptor publication
------------------------------

The following commands are used for publishing mix descriptors and
setting mix descriptor status:

.. code::

   enum {
         /* Extending the wire protocol Commands. */
         post_descriptor(20),
         post_descriptor_status(21),
   }

The structures of these command are defined as follows:

.. code::

      struct {
         uint64_t epoch_number;
         opaque payload[];
      } PostDescriptor;

      struct {
         uint8 error_code;
      } PostDescriptorStatus;

5.1.1 The post_descriptor Command
---------------------------------

   The post_descriptor command allows mixes to publish their
   descriptors.

5.1.2 The post_descriptor_status Command
----------------------------------------

   The post_descriptor_status command is sent in response to a post_descriptor
   command, and uses the following error codes:

.. code::

   enum {
      descriptor_ok(0),
      descriptor_invalid(1),
      descriptor_conflict(2),
      descriptor_forbidden(3),
   } ErrorCodes;

5.2 Voting
----------

   The following commands are used by Authorities to exchange votes:

.. code::

      enum {
         vote(22),
         vote_status(23),
         get_vote(24),
      } Command;

   The structures of these commands are defined as follows:

.. code::

      struct {
          uint64_t epoch_number;
          opaque public_key[ED25519_KEY_LENGTH];
          opaque payload[];
      } VoteCommand;

      struct {
         uint8 error_code;
      } VoteStatusCommand;

5.2.1 The vote Command
----------------------

The ``get_consensus`` command is used to send a PKI document to a peer
Authority during the voting period of the PKI schedule.

The payload field contains the signed and serialized PKI document
representing the sending Authority's vote. The public_key field
contains the public identity key of the sending Authority which the
receiving Authority can use to verify the signature of the payload.
The epoch_number field is used by the receiving party to quickly
check the epoch for the vote before deserializing the payload.

5.2.2 The vote_status Command
-----------------------------

The ``vote_status`` command is used to reply to a vote command. The
error_code field indicates if there was a failure in the receiving
of the PKI document.

.. code::

      enum {
         vote_ok(0),               /* None error condition. */
         vote_too_early(1),        /* The Authority should try again later. */
         vote_too_late(2),         /* This round of voting was missed. */
         vote_not_authorized(3),   /* The voter's key is not white-listed */
         vote_not_signed(4),       /* The vote signature verification failed */
         vote_malformed(5),        /* The vote payload was invalid */
         vote_already_received(6), /* The vote was already received */
         vote_not_found(7),        /* The vote was not found */
      }

The epoch_number field of the vote struct is compared with the
epoch that is currently being voted on. vote_too_early and
vote_too_late are replied back to the voter to report that their
vote was not accepted.

5.2.3 The get_vote Command
--------------------------

   The ``get_vote`` command is used to request a PKI document (vote) from a peer
   Authority. The epoch field contains the epoch from which to request the
   vote, and the public_key field contains the public identity key of the
   Authority of the requested vote. A successful query is responded to with a
   vote command, and queries that fail are responded to with a vote_status
   command with error_code vote_not_found(7).

5.3 Retrieval of Consensus
--------------------------

   Providers in the Katzenpost mix network system [KATZMIXNET]_ may cache
   validated network consensus files and serve them to clients over
   the mix network's link layer wire protocol [KATZMIXWIRE]_. We define
   additional wire protocol commands for requesting and sending PKI
   consensus documents:

.. code::

      enum {
         /* Extending the wire protocol Commands. */
         get_consensus(18),
         consensus(19),
      } Command;

   The structures of these commands are defined as follows:

.. code::

      struct {
          uint64_t epoch_number;
      } GetConsensusCommand;

      struct {
         uint8 error_code;
         opaque payload[];
      } ConsensusCommand;

5.3.1 The get_consensus Command
-------------------------------

   The get_consensus command is a command that is used to retrieve a
   recent consensus document. If a given get_consensus command
   contains an Epoch value that is either too big or too small then a
   reply consensus command is sent with an empty payload. Otherwise if
   the consensus request is valid then a consensus command containing
   a recent consensus document is sent in reply.

   Initiators MUST terminate the session immediately upon reception of
   a get_consensus command.

5.3.2 The consensus Command
---------------------------

   The consensus command is a command that is used to send a
   recent consensus document. The error_code field indicates if there
   was a failure in retrieval of the PKI consensus document.

.. code::

      enum {
         consensus_ok(0),        /* None error condition and SHOULD be accompanied with
                                    a valid consensus payload. */
         consensus_not_found(1), /* The client should try again later. */
         consensus_gone(2),      /* The consensus will not be available in the future. */
      } ErrorCodes;

6. Scalability Considerations
=============================

.. note::

    XXX David: TODO: notes on scaling, bandwidth usage etc.

7. Future Work
==============

   * byzantine fault tolerance

   * PQ crypto signatures for all PKI documents: mix descriptors and
     directories. [SPHINCS256]_ could be used, we already have a golang
     implementation: https://github.com/Yawning/sphincs256/

   * Make a Bandwidth Authority system to measure health of the network.
     Also perform load balancing as described in [PEERFLOW]_?

   * Implement byzantine attack defenses as described in [MIRANDA]_ and
     [MIXRELIABLE]_ where mix link performance proofs are recorded and
     used in a reputation system.

   * Choose a different serialization/schema language?

   * Use a append only merkle tree instead of this voting protocol.


8. Anonymity Considerations
===========================

   * This system is intentionally designed to provide identical
     network consensus documents to each mix client. This mitigates
     epistemic attacks against the client path selection algorithm
     such as fingerprinting and bridge attacks [FINGERPRINTING]_
     [BRIDGING]_.

   * If consensus has failed and thus there is more than one consensus
     file, clients MUST NOT use this compromised consensus and refuse
     to run.

   * We try to avoid randomizing the topology because doing so splits
     the anonymity sets on each mix into two. That is, packets belonging
     to the previous topology versus the current topology are trivially
     distinguishable. On the other hand if enough mixes fall out of
     consensus eventually the mixnet will need to be rebalanced to avoid
     an attacker compromised path selection. One example of this would
     be the case where the adversary controls the only mix is one
     layer of the network topology.


9. Security Considerations
==========================

   * The Directory Authority/PKI system for a given mix network is
     essentially the root of all authority in the system. The PKI
     controls the contents of the network consensus documents that mix
     clients download and use to inform their path selection.
     Therefore if the PKI as a whole becomes compromised then so will
     the rest of the system in terms of providing the main security
     properties described as traffic analysis resistance. Therefore a
     decentralized voting protocol is used so that the system is more
     resiliant when attacked, in accordance with the principle of
     least authority. [SECNOTSEP]_

   * Short epoch durations make it is more practical to make
     corrections to network state using the PKI voting rounds.

   * Fewer epoch keys published in advance is a more conservative
     security policy because it implies reduced exposure to key
     compromise attacks.

   * A bad acting Directory Authority who lies on each vote and votes
     inconsistently can trivially cause a denial of service for each
     voting round.
