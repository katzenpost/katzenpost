.. rubric:: Abstract

   This document describes extensions to the core Katzenpost protocol
   to support Provider-side autoresponders.


.. contents:: :local:

1. Introduction
===============

   This interface is meant to provide support for various autoresponder
   agents ("Kaetzchen") that run on Katzenpost provider instances, thus
   bypassing the need to run a discrete client instance to provide
   functionality.  The use-cases for such agents include, but are not
   limited to, user identity key lookup, a discard address, and a
   loop-back responder for the purpose of cover traffic.

1.1 Conventions Used in This Document
-------------------------------------

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2. Terminology
----------------

   ``SURB`` - "single use reply block"; SURBs are used to achieve
     recipient anonymity, that is to say, SURBs function as a
     cryptographic delivery token that you can give to another
     client entity so that they can send you a message without
     them knowing your identity or location on the network. See
     [SPHINXSPEC] and [SPHINX].

   ``BlockSphinxPlaintext`` - The payload structure which is
     encapsulated by the Sphinx body. It is described in [KATZMIXE2E],
     section "4. Client and Provider processing of received packets".

2. Extension Overview
=====================

   Each Kaetzchen agent will register as a potential recipient on its
   Provider.  When the Provider receives a forward packet destined for
   a Kaetzchen instance, it will hand off the fully unwrapped packet
   along with its corresponding SURB to the agent, which will then
   act on the packet and optionally reply utilizing the SURB.

3. Agent Requirements
=====================

     * Each agent operation MUST be idempotent.

     * Each agent operation request and response MUST fit within one
       Sphinx packet.

     * Each agent SHOULD register a recipient address that is prefixed
       with `+` (Or another standardized delimiter, agreed to by all
       participating providers in a given mixnet.).

     * Each agent SHOULD register a recipient address that consists
       of a [RFC5322] dot-atom value, and MUST register recipient
       addresses that are at most 64 octets in length.

     * The first byte of the agent's response payload MUST be 0x01 to
       allow clients to easily differentiate between SURB-ACKs and
       agent responses.

3.1 Mix Message Formats
-----------------------

Messages from clients to Kaetzchen use the following payload
format in the forward Sphinx packet::

     struct {
       uint8_t flags;
       uint8_t reserved; /* Set to 0x00. */
       select (flags) {
       case 0:
         opaque padding[sizeof(SphinxSURB)];
       case 1:
         SphinxSURB surb;
       }
       opaque plaintext[];
     } KaetzchenMessage;


   The plaintext component of a ``KaetzchenMessage`` MUST be padded by
   appending '0x00' bytes to make the final total size of a
   ``KaetzchenMessage`` equal to that of a ``BlockSphinxPlaintext``.

   Messages (replies) from the  Kaetzchen to client use the following
   payload format in the SURB generated packet::

     struct {
       uint8_t payload_type; /* Set to 0x01 */
       uint8_t reserved; /* Set to 0x00 */
       opaque plaintext[];
     } KaetzchenReply;

   The plaintext component of a ``KaetzchenReply`` MUST be padded by
   appending '0x00' bytes to make the final total size of a
   ``KaetzchenReply`` equal to that of a ``BlockSphinxPlaintext``.

4. PKI Extensions
=================

   Each provider SHOULD publish the list of publicly accessible
   Kaetzchen agent endpoints in its MixDescriptor, along with
   any other information required to utilize the agent.

   Provider should make this information available in the form of a map
   in which the keys are the label used to identify a given service, and the
   value is a map with arbitrary keys.

   Valid service names refer to the services defined in extensions to this
   specification. Every service MUST be implemented by one and only one
   Kaetzchen agent.

   For each service, the provider MUST advertise a field for the endpoint at
   which the Kaetzchen agent can be reached, as a key value pair where the
   key is `endpoint`, and the value is the provider side endpoint identifier.

   ::
   
      { "kaetzchen":
        { "keyserver" : {
               "endpoint": "+keyserver",
               "version" : 1 } },
         { "discard" : {
               "endpoint": "+discard", } },
         { "loop" : {
               "endpoint": "+loopback",
               "restrictedToUsers": true } },
      }


5. Anonymity Considerations
===========================

   In the event that the mix keys for the entire return path are
   compromised, it is possible for adversaries to unwrap the SURB
   and determine the final recipient of the reply.

   Depending on what sort of operations a given agent implements,
   there may be additional anonymity impact that requires separate
   consideration.

   Clients MUST NOT have predictable retranmission otherwise this
   makes active confirmations attacks possible which could be used
   to discover the ingress Provider of the client.

6. Security Considerations
==========================

   It is possible to use this mechanism to flood a victim with unwanted
   traffic by constructing a request with a SURB destined for the target.

   Depending on the operations implemented by each agent, the added
   functionality may end up being a vector for Denial of Service attacks
   in the form of CPU or network overload.

   Unless the agent implements additional encryption, message integrity
   and privacy is limited to that which is provided by the base Sphinx
   packet format and parameterization.

   The inspiration for this extension comes primarily from a design
   by Vincent Breitmoser.
