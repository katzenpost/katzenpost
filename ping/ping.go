var basePayload = []byte(`Data encryption is used widely to protect the content of Internet
communications and enables the myriad of activities that are popular today,
from online banking to chatting with loved ones. However, encryption is not
sufficient to protect the meta-data associated with the communications.

Modern encrypted communication networks are vulnerable to traffic analysis and
can leak such meta-data as the social graph of users, their geographical
location, the timing of messages and their order, message size, and many other
kinds of meta-data.

Since 1979, there has been active academic research into communication
meta-data protection, also called anonymous communication networking, that has
produced various designs. Of these, mix networks are among the most practical
and can readily scale to millions of users.
