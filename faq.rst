What is a mix network?
----------------------

   A mix network is an unreliable packet switching network which
   resists traffic analysis. Mix networks can be designed to provide
   various anonymity properties such as:

      * sender anonymity
      * receiver anonymity
      * sender and receiver anonymity with respect to third party observers

What is Loopix?
---------------

   Loopix is described in the paper "The Loopix Anonymity System"
   published at USENIX 2017, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.00536.pdf

   Briefly, Loopix uses a collection of the best mix network designs
   to create a messaging system that has the property of sender and
   receiver anonymity with respect to third party observers. This
   particular meaning of "anonymity" is remarkably different than what
   Tor provides. Loopix does not have strong location hiding
   properties nor does it provide sender anonymity or receiver
   anonymity. That having been said it should be possible to create
   such systems based on the Loopix design.

   The Loopix design is informed by over 15 years of mixnet literature
   and strives to reduce many kinds of metadata leakages that
   historically have made mix networks vulnerable to long term
   statistical disclosure attacks. Loopix has a defense against
   blending/n-1 attacks. Loopix explores the tradeoff between decoy
   traffic and latency, thus revitalizing mix networks with much lower
   latency for message transportation.

   Loopix uses the Sphinx cryptographic packet format, the Poisson mix
   strategy, three kinds of decoy traffic and the stratified mix
   topology. It's Provider architecture forces long term statistical
   disclosure attacks to take place on the receiver's Provider, thus
   forcing such adversaries to actively compromise Providers instead of
   passively observing the mix network which is in contrast to historical
   mix network designs.

What is Katzenpost?
-------------------

   Katzenpost has the goal of implementing the Loopix designs with the
   additional property of message transport reliability. Reliability
   is achieved using a Stop and Wait ARQ which is half duplex and uses
   SURBs to create the reply channel for the ACKnowledgement messages.

   Why is this a big deal? To our knowledge, no other mix network design
   has attempted to achieve reliability. We believe that the lack of
   reliability has been one of the major obstacles to the adoption
   of mix networks. "Would you want to use a messaging system which
   might not even transport your messages to their destination?"
   
How are mix networks different from Tor?
----------------------------------------

   Tor is stream oriented. Mixnets are message oriented.  Tor is low
   latency, easy to use, has a great primary application (Tor
   Browser), and functions as an extremely useful general purpose
   anonymity system.  This is in contrast to mix networks which do not
   function well as general purpose anonymity systems. Instead mix
   networks are better suited to customization for specific
   applications, for example a mix network for instant messaging and a
   mix network for e-mail will have different traffic patterns and
   therefore require different decoy traffic patterns to achieve the
   desired traffic analysis resistant properties.

   There are also many adversarial model differences between Tor and
   mix networks.  For example, Tor can be easily deanonymized by
   statistical correlation attacks by a sufficiently global adversary
   whereas mixnets are not immediately vulnerable to these kinds of
   attacks if they correctly use mix strategies and decoy traffic.

   Both Tor and mix networks can scale well with respect to
   increasing user traffic, however Tor requires route
   unpredictability to achieve it's anonymity properties. Mix networks
   on the other hand do not require route unpredictability and
   therefore can achieve very strong anonymity properties with far fewer
   network nodes than Tor.

How do mix networks compare to Pond?
------------------------------------

    Pond doesn't actually mix anything whereas mix networks
    specifically contain component mixes, each containing a mix queue
    which "mixes" messages together via some specific mix strategy
    before sending them to the next hop in the route. Pond uses a
    group signature scheme to prevent the server from learning to whom
    a message is being sent to.  Pond uses Tor onion services as it's
    transport while also using decoy traffic to prevent a passive
    network observer from determining when a user sends a message. Mix
    network designs can also use decoy traffic, however in the Loopix
    design there are three different kinds of decoy traffic that serve
    different purposes. Mix networks also scale much better with
    respect to increasing users and traffic whereas pond servers
    quickly become performance bottlenecks. This is in contrast to mix
    networks where additional mixes can be added to the network in
    order to efficiently process increases in user traffic.

How does Vuvuzela differ from Loopix/Katzenpost?
------------------------------------------------

   Vuvuzela uses the cascade mix topology which does not scale
   well with respect to an increase in user traffic. Loopix uses
   the stratified topology which scales very well. In Vuvuzela, messages cannot
   be received when a user is offline. In Loopix messages received
   while a user is offline are queued by their Provider. Vuvuzela operates
   in rounds whereas Loopix does not. Vuvuzela does not provide reliable
   message transportation whereas Katzenpost does.

How does AnonPOP differ from Loopix/Katzenpost?
-----------------------------------------------

   AnonPOP operates in rounds and provides offline storage of messages.
   Loopix uses a continuous time mix strategy so that it avoids
   user synchronization issues. AnonPOP does not provide reliable
   message transportation whereas Katzenpost does.
