// Package thin provides message types for the thin client protocol.
// This file defines the request and response message structures used for
// communication between thin clients and the client daemon via CBOR encoding.
//
// The protocol supports various operations including:
//   - Basic message sending with optional SURBs (Single Use Reply Blocks)
//   - Reliable message delivery using ARQ (Automatic Repeat Request)
//   - Pigeonhole channel operations for persistent communication
//   - Decoy traffic generation for traffic analysis resistance
//
// All messages are serialized using CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation)
// for efficient and reliable communication between client and daemon.
