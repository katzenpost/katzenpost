bsaes is a portable pure-Go constant time AES implementation based on the
excellent code from [BearSSL](https://bearssl.org/).  On appropriate systems,
with a sufficiently recent Go runtime, it will transparently call `crypto/aes`
when `NewCipher` is invoked.

Features:

 * Constant time.

 * 32 bit and 64 bit variants, with the appropriate one selected at runtime.

 * Provides `crypto/cipher.Block`.

 * `crypto/cipher.ctrAble` support for less-slow CTR-AES mode.

 * `crypto/cipher.cbcDecAble` support for less-slow CBC-AES decryption.

 * `crypto/cipher.gcmAble` support for less-slow GCM-AES.  This includes
   a constant time GHASH.

 * The raw guts of the implementations provided as sub-packages, for people
   to use to implement [other things](https://git.schwanenlied.me/yawning/aez).
