EME for Go [![CI](https://github.com/rfjakob/eme/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rfjakob/eme/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/rfjakob/eme?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/rfjakob/eme) ![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)
==========

**EME** (ECB-Mix-ECB or, clearer, **Encrypt-Mix-Encrypt**) is a wide-block
encryption mode developed by Halevi
and Rogaway in 2003 [[eme]](#eme).

EME uses multiple invocations of a block cipher to construct a new
cipher of bigger block size (in multiples of 16 bytes, up to 2048 bytes).

Quoting from the original [[eme]](#eme) paper:

> We describe a block-cipher mode of operation, EME, that turns an n-bit block cipher into
> a tweakable enciphering scheme that acts on strings of mn bits, where m ∈ [1..n]. The mode is
> parallelizable, but as serial-efficient as the non-parallelizable mode CMC [6]. EME can be used
> to solve the disk-sector encryption problem. The algorithm entails two layers of ECB encryption
> and a “lightweight mixing” in between. We prove EME secure, in the reduction-based sense of
> modern cryptography.

Figure 2 from the [[eme]](#eme) paper shows an overview of the transformation:

This is an implementation of EME in Go, complete with test vectors from IEEE [[p1619-2]](#p1619-2)
and Halevi [[eme-32-testvec]](#eme-32-testvec).

It has no dependencies outside the standard library.

Is it patentend?
----------------

In 2007, the UC Davis has decided to abandon [[patabandon]](#patabandon)
the patent application [[patappl]](#patappl) for EME.

Related algorithms
------------------

**EME-32** is EME with the cipher set to AES and the length set to 512.
That is, EME-32 [[eme-32-pdf]](#eme-32-pdf) is a subset of EME.

**EME2**, also known as EME\* [[emestar]](#emestar), is an extended version of EME
that has built-in handling for data that is not a multiple of 16 bytes
long.  
EME2 has been selected for standardization in IEEE P1619.2 [[p1619.2]](#p1619.2).

number of block-cipher blocks. EME-32 is a concrete implementation of
EME with a fixed length of 32 AES blocks.
