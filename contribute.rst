"One patch" rule for Google Summer of Code
==========================================

We require one accepted patch (pull request) from each potential GSoC student, before accepting the student for GSoC participation.
The reason for this requirement is that you can show us that you have succeeded in building Katzenpost, and that you have understood a little piece of Katzenpost's code and are able to improve it.

Keep in mind that mentoring is about providing guidance to help you solve your task, but we don't have the resources at this point to keep holding your hand. It's important for us to know that you can code and solve technical challenges on your own, while also maintaining a constructive dialogue of relevant design decisions with us.
