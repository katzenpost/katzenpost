"One patch" rule for Google Summer of Code
==========================================

We require one accepted patch (pull request) from each potential GSoC student, before accepting the student for GSoC participation.
The reason for this requirement is that you can show us that you have succeeded in building Katzenpost, and that you have understood a little piece of Katzenpost's code and are able to improve it.

Katzenpost is a framework for message anonymization: Its goal is to hide communication metadata from third parties, allowing two parties to communicate securely. **This is a specialized area of research, and we expect potential students to be familiar with Mixnets.** A good starting point is the `Loopix Anonymity System paper <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.00536.pdf>`_. More reading material can be found in the `Mixbib <https://bib.mixnetworks.org/>`_.

Katzenpost's core components are written in Go. We have experimental bindings for Python and Java/Android.

Keep in mind that mentoring is about providing guidance to help you solve your task, but we don't have the resources at this point to keep holding your hand. It's important for us to know that you can code and solve technical challenges on your own, while also maintaining a constructive dialogue of relevant design decisions with us.
