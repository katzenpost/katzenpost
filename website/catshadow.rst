Catshadow
=========

Our premiere mix network client, catshadow is a work-in-progress:

https://github.com/katzenpost/katzenpost/catshadow

Catshadow provides mutual location hiding properties between
communication partners. Clients make use of the PANDA (Phrase
Automated Nym Discovery Authentication) protocol for exchanging spool
identities and the Signal Double Ratchet keys. That is, this messaging
system creates bidirectional metadata leakage resistant communications
channels which are composed with two unidirection channels. Each
unidirectional channel contains the required information to write to a
correspondant's remote message spool.
