HACKING Katzenpost
==================


Getting started in Katzenpost development
=========================================

This guide assumes you are familiar with golang,
git and Unix like operating system environment.


Overview of our git repositories
--------------------------------

We do some additional ticket tracking in:

* mixnet_uprising - Repository for tracking open tasks for the
  Katzenpost mixnet framework.


Our specs, drafts and other documents are in:

* docs -  The documentation is here with the exception of the
  website. This includes the design specifications as well as the
  document you are currently reading.


The mix server and directory authority libraries both make use
of our core library:

* core - Core library

* server - Mix server

* authority - Mix PKI, nonvoting and voting Directory Authority servers and clients

* tools - Tools are programs that we use for testing and debugging.

Our core library's wire protocol depends on our fork
of the golang noise library:

* noise - The Katzenpost fork of flynn's golang Noise crypto library
  implementation which has the ablity to use the New Hope Simple
  post quantum hybrid key exchange for forward secrecy.


Clients also use the core library:

* minclient - Minimal client library which is the basis for all
  other mix clients.

* mailproxy - High-level client library with optional reliability and
  optional SMTP and POP3 listeners.

* client - Experimental client library implementing proper Loopix decoy
  traffic et cetera.


Our website:

* website - The Katzenpost website


The rest of these repositories do not currently have a maintainer
associated with them and it is likely they have bitrot:

* bindings - Language bindings for Java and Python. STATUS: NOT finished.

* nixops - NixOS automated configuration for Katzenpost server components.

* nixpkg - NixOS packages for Katzenpost components.

* pykatzenpost - Python client library for Katzenpost.

* katzsim - Client simulator for load testing mix servers.

* katzenpost-android-mail - A Katzenpost client, based on K-9 Mail.

* pykatzen-auth - Optional Katzenpost server authentication module in python.


development workflow
--------------------

0. Acquire a recent version of golang (go1.11 or later) so that
   you can use the go-modules features for dependency version pinning!
   Read about go-modules here:

   * https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules

1. Setup proper golang environment variables such
   as GOPATH, GOROOT and GO111MODULE, for example:
   ::

      export GO111MODULE=on
      export GOPATH=/home/user/gopath
      export GOROOT=/home/user/code/go

2. Checkout the latest master branch of the component you
   are interested in building:
   ::

      cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/katzenpost/
      git clone https://github.com/katzenpost/server.git
      cd server
      git checkout master

3. Edit the source code and make it do cool stuff.

4. Track a new dependency with go-modules:
   ::

      cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/katzenpost/server/
      go get github.com/foo/bar@v1.2.3

   Or perhaps you'd like to build with the master branch of such a dependency:
   ::

      cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/katzenpost/server/
      go get github.com/foo/bar@master

5. Build the binary.
   ::

      cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/katzenpost/server/cmd/server
      go build


client and server internals
---------------------------

The Katzenpost server repository has several coding themes which you
should become familiar with before making a contribution. The server
must not have any unbounded resource consumption such as spawning new
go routines for example.


the Worker type
```````````````

Katzenpost is NOT crash-only software! Everything has a proper
shutdown code path unlike many golang examples on the
Internet. Struct types which act as worker goroutines MUST be a
composite struct type with the Worker type which is defined in our
"core" repository here:

* https://github.com/katzenpost/core/blob/master/worker/worker.go

Correctly implementing a composite Worker type means that your
code uses the Worker's Go method to spawn new goroutines and will
halt it's runtime loop upon receiving from the channel returned
by the Worker's HaltCh method. There are plenty of examples of this
in our code.


the Channels library
````````````````````

The Katzenpost mix server and mailproxy both use the EApache Channels library:

* https://gopkg.in/eapache/channels.v1

Channels API docs:

* https://godoc.org/gopkg.in/eapache/channels.v1

Channels code:

* https://github.com/eapache/channels/tree/v1.1.0

The extended functionality of these channels is well suited to
building various kinds of computational pipelines. In particular
throughout the code base you will see "infinite buffered channels"
used as a queue connecting the schedulers of pipeline stages.
More discussion on this pipeline model is below in the next section.


the SEDA model
``````````````

The Katzenpost server is essentially a software based router and as
such it utilizes three active queue management algorithms
(AQMs). These queues are called the ingress queue, the mix strategy
queue and the egress queue. We utilize a computational model called
SEDA or Staged Even Driven Architecture where these three queues are
pipelined together.

At each stage of the pipeline there is a thread pool of workers which
perform the computation for that stage. Between each of these stages
is an AQM which can drop work tasks and can have dynamic load shedding
properties so that performance degrades gracefully with respect to
increased work load.

If you'd like to learn more about the SEDA computation model we
recommend reading:

* "SEDA: An Architecture for Well-Conditioned, Scalable Internet Services",
  http://www.sosp.org/2001/papers/welsh.pdf


the mix strategy
````````````````

Currently Katzenpost only supports the Poisson mix strategy and
therefore the mix strategy AQM is implemented using a priority
queue. To learn more about the Poisson mix strategy you should read:

* "The Loopix Anonymity System",
  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.00536.pdf

* "Stop-and-Go-MIXes Providing Probabilistic Anonymity in an Open System",
  https://www.freehaven.net/anonbib/cache/stop-and-go.pdf

                                    '------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------'


Exercising Katzenpost with your own private mixnet
--------------------------------------------------

For many circumstances it is easier and more appropriate to perform your
integration testing on a mixnet deployed to a single machine, a remote
server which could be a VM instance. In that case I would compile my katzenpost
binaries locally and upload them to my remote server and then run a bash script
to restart the services.

You will most likely want to turn on debug logging for all the mixnet services.
Checking these debug log can help you determine if the behavior is correct.
Certainly you could do all of this and add extra debug log statements to help
track down a problem that would otherwise be very difficult to detect.


Making a code contribution
--------------------------

0. Meet the Katzenpost developers

   Chat with the Katzenpost developers on irc: #katzenpost on the OFTC
   network or reach out to us on our mailing list:
   https://lists.mixnetworks.org/listinfo/katzenpost

   It is a good idea to discuss your code change with us before
   investing your time in writing the code.

   These days the IRC channel is not so active. Try contacting us over the mailing list.

1. Write a specification document

   If your code change is complex or requires us to change any of our
   protocols, you will need to first propose a draft specification
   document. You can do this by forking our docs repository, creating
   a new git branch with your specification document and then
   submitting a pull-request.

2. Document the work task

   Open a ticket to document your feature addition or code change using
   the repository's issue tracker.

3. Testing your code

   Your code should have unit tests. However you may wish to gain
   extra confidence in your code addition by using our kimchi tool.

4. Request code review

   Finally you can submit a pull-request for your code changes or
   additions. We will review your code. There may be several rounds
   of code reviews until the code is of sufficient quality to be
   merged.
