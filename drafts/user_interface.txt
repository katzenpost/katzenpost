Abstract

   This document describes the user interface design of the Katzenpost
   mix network.

1. Introduction

   This user interface is meant to mimic the e-mail experience in
   several ways, by allowing existing e-mail programs to interact with
   a mixnet SMTP submission proxy and a POP3 receive proxy. We will
   also suggest specific e-mail client modifications that will present
   some special mixnet specific indicators to the user.

1.1 Terminology

   * MTA - mail transfer agent, refers to a mail server

   * SMTP - simple mail transfer protocol, this is the protocol
     used by e-mail clients for sending mail [RFC5321] [RFC6409]

   * POP3 - post office protocol version 3, a commonly used protocol
     for retrieving mail from a remote server [RFC1939] [RFC2449]

2. System Overview

   Our messaging system user interface design has the goal of
   satisfying one of the two primary obstacles for user adoption,
   namely interoperability. [ADOPT17] What we mean here by
   interoperability is that any e-mail client is able to function
   correctly with our SMTP submission proxy and POP3 retrieval proxy
   components which run locally with the e-mail client.

   We shall also maintain strict adherence to various secure user
   interface design principles such as the "Principle of the Path of
   Least Resistance" which in this context could mean that no extra
   action on the part of the user is required to encrypt a message
   because encryption is used by default all the time. [YEE02]

   The mix network client is essentially split up into two components
   the SMTP proxy and the POP3 proxy. The POP3 proxy only needs to
   communicate with the mixnet PKI to retrieve the user's mail queue
   connection information whereas the SMTP proxy makes more use of the
   PKI in order to perform mix network path selection, mix key
   retrieval for Sphinx packet composition.

3. Behavior of the SMTP submission proxy

   Submission proxy three point plan:

   * The SMTP proxy will refuse to queue a message if the recipient's
     key is not available and issue the SMTP error message:

         455 Server unable to accommodate parameters

   * The SMTP proxy will refuse to queue the message if the mixnet is
     not available with the following error message:

         450 Requested mail action not taken: mailbox unavailable.

   * Mail delivery failures will be indicated by the reception of
     bounce messages.

4. Behavior of the POP3 retrieval proxy

5. Behavior of the e-mail client / K9mail

   This section specifies features and user interfaces changes to the
   K9mail e-mail client software. In principle these changes could be
   done to any existing e-mail client however it should also be
   possible to use an e-mail client without these user interface
   enhancements.

   The e-mail client should feature the ability for the user to send
   messages as multiple identities and their corresponding
   key-pairs. The sender identity is specified in the mail header
   field like so:

      X-Katzenpost-Sender: <base64 X25519 key>
