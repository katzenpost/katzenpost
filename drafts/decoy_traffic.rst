This document describes the various types of decoy traffic designs
based on the [LOOPIX]_ paper and is meant to be read with [KATZCLIENT]_
and [KATZDEADDROP]_.

1. Introduction
===============

To a passive network observer or a component mix, decoy traffic (often
referred as 'cover traffic' or dummy messages) is indistinguishable
from normal traffic. The [LOOPIX]_ and [ANONTRILEMMA]_ papers describe
a trade off between latency and decoy traffic. Decoy traffic adds
entropy to component mixes, which means that more decoy traffic can be
used so lower per hop delay is used, while still maintaining the
desired mix entropy.

Decoy traffic loops are used by mixes to detect *n-1* attacks
[HEARTBEAT03]_. This means that mix decoy loop traffic serves a dual
purpose of detecting *n-1* attacks while contributing entropy to
various mixes.

Decoy traffic also contributes to sender and receiver
unobservability. A global passive adversary will not be able
to determine whether a user is communicating with another (by either sending
or receiving messages), as observed honest messages are indistinguishable
from decoy messages.

The [LOOPIX]_ design specifies a slightly different decoy traffic profile
than the one described here. The Loopix design does not attempt to achieve
any reliability, while the present document does. Fundamentally, mix
networks are unreliable packet switching networks: without the use of
additional client side protocols, they cannot achieve reliability.
The Katzenpost design, on the other hand, aims to achieve reliability
through the use of an automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocol scheme.
An ARQ protocol is a type of error correction protocol that makes use of
acknowledgement control messages and retransmissions. The
most notable example of a protocol making use of an ARQ scheme is TCP.

The [LOOPIX]_ design achieves it's security goals of sender and receiver
unobservability with respect to compromised providers and passive network
observers. It does so by using two types of client decoy traffic. In the
Katzenpost design, clients must use two SURB loops instead of the routing
loops that are described in the Loopix paper. This is because client Providers
never receive decoy traffic and instead only receive SURB replies.

1.1 Conventions Used in This Document
-------------------------------------

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]_.

1.2 Terminology
---------------

* ``decoy traffic`` - Mix network messages that add entropy and help
  defend against certain kind of attacks. Also referred to as dummy
  or cover traffic.

* ``message`` - A variable-length sequence of bytes sent anonymously
  through the network. Short messages are sent in a single
  packet; long messages are fragmented across multiple
  packets (see [KATZMIXE2E]_).

* ``packet`` - A Sphinx packet is a nested cryptographic packet
  which is described in [SPHINX]_ and [SPHINXSPEC]_.

* ``forward message`` - A message sent using a Sphinx packet with the
  terminal hop routing slot containing only a ``recipient`` Sphinx
  routing comment. This Sphinx packet contains a ``SURB`` in the payload
  so that the receiving Provider may reply with a ``SURB ACK``.

* ``ACK`` - Acknowledgement. A control message used in ARQ protocols.

* ``ARQ`` - Automatic Repeat reQuest. An error correction protocol scheme
  which makes use of acknowledegement control messages and retransmissions.

* ``SURB`` - The Single Use Reply Block is a feature of the Sphinx packet
  format and is described in [SPHINX]_ and in section
  ``7. Single Use Reply Block (SURB) Creation`` of [SPHINXSPEC]_.

* ``SURB reply`` - A message sent using a Sphinx packet which is
  composed using a SURB where the last hop routing information
  contains a ``surb_reply`` routing command.

* ``SURB ACK`` - An acknowledgement control message is a ``SURB reply``
  which contains a payload of all zeros rather than useful information.
  It acts as an important part of an ARQ protocol scheme.

* ``service query`` - A forward message whose destination is a
  Provider-side Autoresponder [KAETZCHEN]_ service.

* ``query reply`` - A message sent in reponse to a ``service query``
  which is encapsulated in a Sphinx packet composed using a SURB.
  See [KAETZCHEN]_.

1.3 Preliminary Sphinx Routing Considerations
---------------------------------------------

Section ``4.1.1 Per-hop routing information`` of the [SPHINXSPEC]_
states that the Sphinx packet header contains a vector of per-hop
routing information. Each mix in turn decrypts it's portion of this
routing information. In the case of the final hop, the Provider
decrypting this routing information should find either a `recipient`
command, or `recipient` and `surb_reply` commands [KATZMIXE2E]_.
Therefore Providers receiving Sphinx packets are able to distinguish
between ``forward messages`` and replies generated using SURBs such as
a ``SURB ACK`` or a ``query reply``.

2. Client SURB Loops
====================

SURB loops differ slightly from client and mix loops as described
in the [LOOPIX]_ paper; the return flight is routed by means of a
SURB. In other words, clients or mixes may form a SURB loop by sending
a message with a SURB to a Provider-side Autoresponder [KAETZCHEN]_
``loop`` service. This ``loop`` service uses the SURB to send a reply
back to the source.

In the Katzenpost mix network all Provider services respond using a
SURB and Providers also send a ``SURB ACK`` in response to receiving a
``forward messages``. From the perspective of the Provider receiving
these SURB replies, all of these messages are indistinguishable.
That is, ``query replies`` from a ``loop service`` are
indistinguishable from ``query replies`` from any other service.
They are are indistinguishable from ``SURB ACKs``.

2.1 Sender Unobservability
--------------------------

Client SURB loops provide sender unobservability with respect to
passive network observers and compromised Providers. This means that, if
the client's Provider is compromised, the adversary gains no advantage, and
the client's SURB loops are indistinguishable from normal forward traffic.

2.2 Receiver Unobservability
----------------------------

Client SURB loops provides receiver unobservability with respect to
a passive network adversary. That is, passive network adversaries
are not able to distinguish between SURB replies from a client
SURB loop and normal forward received messages.

However, if the client's Provider is compromised, the adversary will
be able to distinguish between the SURB reply and a received forward
message by means of the Sphinx routing commands.

4. Client Drop Decoys
=====================

The Katzenpost design defines client drop decoy messages by composing Sphinx
packets destined for the ``loop service`` of a randomly selected
Provider. The payload of this Sphinx packet does not contain a SURB
and, therefore, the ``loop service`` has no choice but to drop the
message without sending a response.

As stated in section ``3. Client Routing Loops without SURBs``, clients
must send drop messages so that the number of sent and received
messages are not equal. This is used to thwart an adversary who has
compromised the client's Provider.

5. Client Decoy Traffic Conclusions
===================================

Clients send forward messages and decoy loop messages. Loop decoy
messages are addressed to the sending client whereas forward messages
are destined for other clients or servers. An idle client sends just
as many messages as a busy client on average.

Just as is described in the [LOOPIX]_ paper, Client's make use for 4
Poisson processes, the first is used to select delay for each hop:

* ``μ`` - Delay for each hop.

The next three Poisson processes are used by the client to select delays
between sending various types of messages into the mixnet:

* ``λP`` - Time interval between sending messages from the egress queue.
* ``λL`` - Loop traffic rate.
* ``λD`` - Drop traffic rate.

Unlike the Loopix paper, client loops use a SURB reply for it's return
flight back to the client. The λP Poisson process is used to set the
time interval between sending messages from the egress FIFO queue. If
the FIFO queue is empty then a decoy drop message is sent instead.

Here's a diagram which shows a client sending a message through the mix
network AND in this case the destination could be a Provider service or the
spool of another user on a Provider:

This next diagram shows the reply being routed back to the client by means of
the Single Use Reply Block (see [SPHINXSPEC]_ ):

This is indistinguishable from client decoy loop messages.

6. Mix Loops For Detecting n-1 Attacks
======================================

XXX TODO: finish me.

X. Anonymity Considerations
===========================

A global adversary will be able to determine which users are online or
offline. Decoy traffic is not guaranteed to prevent long term
intersection attacks if users go offline. [RESISTDISCLOSURE]_
Preventing long term statistical disclosure attacks depends on many
factors including the type of applications using the mixnet, the rate
of information leakage and the measure of predictable and repetitive
behavior.
