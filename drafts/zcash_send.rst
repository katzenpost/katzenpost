.. rubric:: Abstract

This document describes an unreliable unidirectional protocol and the
Zcash transaction submission mixnet service [KAETZCHEN]_ which allows
clients of the mix network to anonymously write transactions to the
Zcash blockchain.

1. Introduction
===============

The primary use case for this protocol is to facilitate the development
of superior Zcash wallets with the highest degree of traffic analysis
resistance.


1.1 Terminology
----------------

   ``Provider`` - A service operated by a third party that Clients
     communicate directly with to communicate with the Mixnet.  It is
     responsible for Client authentication, forwarding outgoing
     messages to the Mixnet, and storing incoming messages for the
     Client. The Provider MUST have the ability to perform
     cryptographic operations on the relayed packets.

   ``Kaetzchen`` - A Provider-side autoresponder service as defined in
     [KAETZCHEN]_.


1.2 Conventions Used in This Document
-------------------------------------

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]_.


2. System Overview
==================

The Zcash sending wallet MUST be in possession of the cryptographic and
connection information which gives us the capability to send and
receive messages on the mix network. The Katzenpost architecture
[KATZMIXNET]_ describes the PKI as providing a complete network view
to clients. [KATZMIXPKI]_ This network consensus document is used by
clients to learn about the mixes and services on the network. [KAETZCHEN]_

Providers are mixes in the network that provide additional services.
In the Loopix and Katzenpost architecture Providers form the perimeter
of the network and therefore route all incoming connections from
clients if they pass the access control check using cryptographic
authentication. [KATZMIXWIRE]_  [KATZMIXE2E]_ Providers are also the
destination of each route and queue messages until a client retrieves it.

In contrast, this crypto currency submission protocol does not
have any need to queue messages. Authenticating clients at the network
perimeter is a policy decision and is therefore out of scope here.

The Zcash sender composes a transaction and passes it's serialized
blob form into the protocol library. A Sphinx packet is created and is
sent over the mixnet link layer [KATZMIXWIRE]_ to the entry point, the
client's Provider. This Sphinx packet is routed through the network
and the Provider is the first to remove a layer of Sphinx encryption.
Once the packet arrives at it's destination Provider, the Zcash
transaction submission service receives the transaction submission
request.

::

     .--------.        .----------.        .-------.        .-------.       .----------.
     | Sender |  --->  | Provider |  --->  |  Mix  |  --->  |  Mix  |  ---> | Provider |
     `--------'        `----------'        `-------'        `-------'       '----------'

On the "server side", the Provider receives the Sphinx packet and
decrypts it's payload and then passes the plaintext to the "Zcash
Submission Provider-side Service" module which parses the JSON blob
and submits the transaction blob to the Zcash blockchain using the
zcashd client RPC. No receipt or acknowledgement is produced. Handling
any kind of failure is out of scope.


2.1 Protocol Goals
------------------

Our goals include:

* Sender Unobservability:

Prevention of any network observer from learning when a client sends a
legitimate message (in this context a Zcash transaction). Clients
therefore periodically send decoy traffic AND legitimate traffic as
described in [LOOPIX]_ however for this application we DO NOT NEED
loop traffic of any kind, nor do we need decoy loops since this
protocol is unidirectional AND unreliable.

* Client To Transaction Unlinkability:

We desire to make it very difficult for active and passive network
adversaries to link a specific transaction to a specific client.


3. The Provider-side Zcash Transaction Submission Service
=========================================================

Kaetzchen [KAETZCHEN]_ services are a request-response protocol
API where responses are optional. In this protocol no response is sent.
The client puts their transaction blob inside of a ZcashRequest
and sends it to this service.


3.1 ZcashRequest Message Format
-------------------------------
::

   type zcashRequest struct {
        Version int
	Tx      string
   }

The ``Tx`` field must be populated with the transaction blob in hex
string format.


3.2 Submission Service Behavior
-------------------------------

The submission service uses a HTTP JSON RPC to submit transactions to
the blockchain using the ``sendrawtransaction`` RPC command which
works for Bitcoin as well as Zcash. [ZCASHPAYMENTAPI]_
[ZCASHINTEGRATION]_  [BTCRPC]_

Here's an example JSON blob::
  {"jsonrpc":"1.0","method":"sendrawtransaction","params":["030000807082c40301ee9aa1a0f1212131580f546903997eff6f2e3d3a8262b40c676dc2ba1aa7094b010000006b483045022100f3e5a20c7246545352c90971bb7e5d335d424b3ead78c1aefa95a630b0da577202203609bbadcddc7a89951636212643e57be2dbff4f718ef2b0ad9a41a9001c4b860121038d17c14225360038a5b6dfd063bfbe53a6e014c33f1f2bc6b49babe896595f7dfeffffff0200a3e111000000001976a914681a2881e0369225b353ff737d562ae5b60f6aca88acdd1b6403000000001976a91471257ac18b24ac66774f772782856fcedda5599288ac1f4d03003e4d030000",true],"id":6439}

4. Client Behavior and Programming Interface
============================================


4.1 Starting and Stopping the Client
------------------------------------

Requirements:

* PKI connection information
* PKI key material for signature verification
* optional Provider access credential

Using the above information the client ensures that it always
has a fresh PKI consensus document. The client periodically
sends decoy drop messages to randomly selected Providers as
described in the Loopix paper [LOOPIX]_.

The optional Provider access credential is currently being
used by the Katzenpost system, an X25519 public key and a username
are stored on the Provider's user database. This in part is used
to restrict access to the user's mailbox stored on the Provider
however in our case we either wish to restrict access to the entire
mixnet or we want an open use mix network. This policy decision
affects which information a client will need.


4.2 Send Raw Transaction
------------------------

1. The client checks a fresh PKI consensus document for advertized Zcash
submission services. The client chooses one at random to use.

2. Sends the raw transaction as a hex string.


5. Performance and Scaling Considerations
=========================================

As mentioned in [KATZMIXNET]_ the mix network should utilize the
stratified topology to spread the Sphinx packet traffic load. The
mixes present at each strata are added or removed according to the
PKI. Therefore the PKI is used to close the feedback loop for
dynamically adjusting the load on the network.

The Zcash transaction submissions can also similarly be loadbalanced.
One or more Zcash submission services can be operated on the mix
network. They will all be advertized in the PKI consensus document as
mentioned in [KAETZCHEN]_.


6. Anonymity Considerations
===========================

* Using an entry Provider for many uses and for long periods of time
  may be an unnecessary information leakage towards the operator of
  that Provider. Instead it may be preferable to have an "open mixnet"
  where clients can connect to any entry Provider to inject their
  Sphinx packets into the network.


7. Security Considerations
==========================

* Unlike the Katzenpost client to client protocol as described in
  [KATZMIXE2E]_, this protocol uses a Provider-side service
  [KAETZCHEN]_ and therefore the Sphinx encryption is sufficient to
  protect the confidentiality and integrity of the payload.


8. Future Work and Research
===========================

 * Compose a reliable Zcash submission protocol library where the
   client checks the blockchain to see if the transaction was
   successfully transmitted; using this information instead of
   ACKnowledgment messages an Automatic Repeat reQuest protocol scheme
   can be conceived.

 * Compose a semi-reliable Zcash submission protocol that uses client
   decoy loops. The successful acquisition of a transaction blob by
   the Zcash submission service triggers the response with a SURB
   ACKnowledgement message as described in [KATZMIXE2E]_. Clients
   periodically send decoy traffic as client loops and these are
   indistinguishable from transaction submission messages from the
   point of view of a passive network observers and all network
   operators but the destination Provider.

 * Nothing here is specific to Zcash. There could also be a Bitcoin
   transaction submission service. These two transaction submission
   services SHOULD be on the same mix network and thereby both benefit
   from increasing each other's anonymity set size.
