Abstract

   This document describes the various types of decoy traffic designs
   based on the [LOOPIX] paper. Decoy traffic can serve multiple
   purposes such as detecting n-1 attacks, providing sender and
   receiver unobservability, adding entropy to mixes and mitigating
   statistical disclosure attacks.

1. Introduction

   To a passive network observer or a component mix, decoy traffic is
   indistinguishable from normal traffic. The [LOOPIX] paper describes
   a trade off between latency and decoy traffic. That is to say,
   decoy traffic adds entropy to component mixes which means that a
   lower per hop delay can be used while still maintaining desired mix
   entropy. In the sections that follow we detail precisely how to
   tune decoy traffic for several purposes.

   Decoy traffic loops are used by mixes to detect n-1 attacks
   [HEARTBEAT03]. In this case it serves dual purposes because it is
   also contributing entropy to the mixes that the loop decoy traffic
   messages are routed through.

   Decoy traffic also serves to provide sender and receiver
   unobservability. That is, a passive network observer will not be
   able to determine when a user is sending a message or receiving a
   message, because observed messages may be decoy messages.

   The main purpose for decoy traffic is to mitigate statistical
   disclosure attacks. However, mix networks always leak
   information. Therefore, a long-term statistical disclosure attack
   that converges on success is largely dependent upon how well the
   adversary can predict client behavior and how repetitive this
   behavior is.

1.1 Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2 Terminology

   decoy traffic - Mix network messages that add entropy and help
                   defend against attacks. Also referred to as traffic
                   padding and dummy traffic.

   Message - A variable-length sequence of octets sent anonymously
             through the network. Short messages are sent in a single
             packet; long messages are fragmented across multiple
             packets (see [PANEND2END]).

   packet - A Sphinx packet is a nested cryptographic packet
            which is described in [SPHINX] and [SPHINXSPEC].

2. Katzenpost Loops

   In the [LOOPIX] paper mix loops are achieved using a routing loop
   in the Sphinx header where one hop in the route is a Provider who
   routes the message to the next specified mix in the route. In this
   case the Provider distinguishes this message from the other
   messages it receives. In our Katzenpost design, Clients send mix
   loops using a Katzenpost Provider-side Autoresponder [KAETZCHEN]
   loop service. From the Provider's perspective these mix loops are
   indistinguishable from client originated loops which also use the
   Autoresponder.

2.1 Detecting and Mitigating n-1 Attacks

   Blending attacks, also known as n-1 attacks can be detected using a
   heartbeat protocol [HEARTBEAT03] where mixes send themselves decoy
   traffic loops. These mix messages will appear to other mixes and
   passive network observers to be indistinguishable from normal mix
   traffic. These self-destined Sphinx packets function as heartbeat
   messages that the mix uses to determine if there is an active
   network attack that is delaying or dropping incoming messages such
   as would be the case with an n-1 attack. [TRICKLE02]

   In the context of [LOOPIX] and the Poisson mix strategy
   [KESDOGAN98], mixes use a Poisson process to send mix decoy loops,
   tuned using a parameter we shall refer to as LAMBDA_M, which is the
   inverse of the mean of the exponential distribution in
   milliseconds. Since the user selects all the mix strategy delays
   for each hop in the loop, the timeout duration is simply the RTT
   with some safety margin added to account for additional minor
   delays due to network transit time. Given LAMBDA_M (aka λ_M in the
   Loopix paper), the sender just draws a random value from
   Exp(LAMBDA_M).

   For each sent heartbeat message, the client sets a timer for it's
   expected return. If the heartbeat does not return in time then the
   heartbeat failure code path is used. It seems for failures we have
   three behaviors to mitigate these attacks:

      a. cease all mix operations
      b. send decoy traffic

3. Mitigating Intersection Attacks with Decoy Traffic
3.1 Client Decoy Loops
3.2 Client Decoy Drops

X. Anonymity Considerations

   A global adversary will be able to determine which users are online
   or offline. Decoy traffic cannot guarantee prevention of long term
   intersection attacks if some users go offline. [RESISTDISCLOSURE]
   Preventing long term statistical disclosure attacks depends on many
   factors including mix network information leakage and the measure
   of predictable and repetitive user behavior.

   Katzenpost decoy loops implemented using the Kaetzchen
   auto-responder provides an additional measure of
   indistinguishability from the perspective of the Provider in the
   loop route. Client and Mix loops will be indistinguishable from
   each other.
