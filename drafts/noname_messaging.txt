Noname Messaging System Specification
David Stainton

Version 0

Abstract

   This document describes the high level architecture of the Noname
   Messaging System which is specifically designed to provide strong
   location hiding properties, tunable resistance to longterm
   statistical disclosure attacks and resistance to some active
   attacks.

1. Introduction

   This specification is inspired by Pond and Petmail [POND] [PETMAIL]
   and also uses many designs from the mix network literature,
   especially the [LOOPIX], Katzenpost [KATZMIXNET] and [MIXMINION]
   systems. I describes a variation of the Katzenpost decryption mix
   network messaging system where clients use the PANDA protocol to
   establish bidirectional communication channels. These channels are
   composed by the communication participants exchanging one or more
   descriptors of unidirectional dead drops and ephemeral keys for the
   Signal Double Ratchet. [SIGNAL]

   This document is meant to be read with the accompanying
   specification documents:

1.1 Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2 Terminology

   * ARQ - Automatic Repeat reQuest, a protocol scheme which
     uses ACKnowledgement messages AND retransmissions to achieve
     end to end reliability.

   * PANDA - Phrase Automated Nym Discovery Authentication; a
     variation of a Password Authenticated Key Exchange where clients
     have identical behavior and perform their message exchanges
     asynchronously with a simple server which enforces two message
     slots per "meeting place". See [PANDA] and [PANDASPEC] for more info.

   * SURB - Single Use Reply Block is a cryptographic delivery
     token which was first introduced by the Mixminion design
     [MIXMINION] and revised by the Sphinx cryptographic packet format.
     [SPHINX] [SPHINXSPEC]

1.3 Differences From The Katzenpost Messaging System

   * Contact discovery, key exchanges and communication channel setup
     is done using the PANDA protocol. [PANDA] There is no universal
     naming scheme for mailbox addresses and no spam problem either.

   * End to end message encryption is done using the Signal Double
     Ratchet instead of using static keys in a one-way Noise handshake
     pattern. [NOISE]

   * Sphinx packet cryptographic primitives have been changed to make
     it easier to implement and to provide slightly more conservative
     choices in terms of cryptographic security at the expense of
     speed and additional Sphinx packet overhead. See section
     "4. Packet Format" of this document for the details.

2. System Overview

   Mixminion introduced the Single Use Reply Block, also known as a
   SURB which is a cryptographic delivery token for latent message
   delivery. SURBs have a relatively short lifetime because they are
   essentially a mixnet packet header which is encrypted with the
   routing keys of several mixes and therefore expire when any of the
   mixes rotate their key. In the Katzenpost system this key rotation
   epoch is every 3 hours. [KATZMIXPKI] It is NOT desireable to have
   long lived mix routing keys because this increases the amount of time
   required to perform a compulsion attack. We conclude that SURBs are NOT
   suitable for establishing a bidirectional communication channel for
   clients that frequently go offline for time durations greater than
   the mix key rotation epoch. Instead a Katzenpost autoresponder
   [KAETZCHEN] based dead drop [KATZDEADDROP] service can be used.

   Unlike SURBs dead drop descriptors do not have any inherent
   expiration. However, for the purpose of reducing exposure to
   longterm statistical disclosure attacks, these descriptors shall
   specify an expiration. The expiration specifies how far into the
   future the receiver promises to check for messages in the dead drop
   queue. Client communication partners MUST periodically exchange new
   dead drop descriptors before the old dead drop descriptors expire.

   Communication partnerships are established by using the PANDA
   protocol [PANDA] to facilitate a Signal handshake and an exchange
   of dead drop delivery descriptors. Reliability is achieved using
   two differently tuned ARQ protocols, providing reliability for
   communication from client to client as well as client to dead
   drop. Clients use a cryptographic storage subsystem to persist
   their state (consisting of key material, cryptographic ratchet
   state, dead drop delivery descriptors and ARQ scheduler state).

   Dead drops can also be used for one-way communication. Consider for
   instance a user, Alice who reads a message on a anonymous bulletine
   board system and replies using the supplied dead drop
   descriptor. Alice can optionally include a dead drop descriptor in
   her message. This would establish a full-duplex communication
   channel.

3. Threat Model

3.1 Security Goals

   Noname clients make use of several dead drops, one for each contact
   for the purpose of queueing received encrypted messages for later
   retrieval. We have several security goals for this delivery
   protocol, we shall proceed with Brian Warner's mode of analysis and
   quote several security properties from the [PETMAIL] document :

      """
      * S0: Two different senders cannot tell if they're talking to the
        same recipient or not.
   
      * M0: The mailbox server cannot tell which message came from which
        sender, not even that two messages came from the same sender, nor
        can it determine how many senders might be configured for each
        recipient.

      * R0: The recipient can use the transport information to accurately
        identify the sender.

      * Rev0: R can revoke one sender without involving the remaining ones.
      """

   Our Noname messaging security goals in short form are expressed as:

      S0 M0 R0 Rev0

3.2 Categories of Attacks

   This system uses a decryption mix network based transport and therefore is
   vulnerable to several attack categories:

      * epistemic attacks

      * n-1 attacks (also known as blending attacks)

      * compulsion attacks

      * statistical disclosure attacks

      * tagging and replay attacks

      * denial of service attacks

   The mix network AND Providers are operated by a closed set of
   entities which are authorized by the Directory Authority system's
   whitelist of mix operator signing keys. [KATZMIXPKI] This Directory
   Authority system is a semi-decentralized system that uses a
   cryptographic threshold voting scheme to produce a full view of the
   network. Epistemic attacks are avoided by providing all clients
   with the full view of the network. A partial view would make
   clients vulnerable to epistemic attacks such as [FINGERPRINTING]
   [BRIDGING] [LOCALVIEW].

   We currently do not have any defences for n-1 attacks. If each
   mix sends itself heartbeat messages then when the heartbeat message
   is not received in time this either means:

      * network congestion causing some packet loss
      * temporary network outage
      * denial of service attack

   Not knowing how to distinguish between these three cases from only
   the heartbeat protocol signal means that we SHOULD NOT send
   increased amounts of decoy traffic in response to packet loss as
   [HEARTBEAT03] suggests.

   Vulnerability to compulsion attacks is mainly mitigated by means of
   the epoch key rotation where each participating mix destroys it's
   Sphinx routing key and uses a new key. Future implementations may
   include additional defenses. [FORWARDMIX] [COMPULS05]

   Various design elements help to defend against longterm statistical
   disclosure attacks (also known as intersection attacks) such as:

      * Loopix decoy traffic

      * short term Provider with message queueing and
        direction wire protocol for message retrieval [KATZMIXWIRE]

      * medium term Provider with messaging queueing and remote
        retrieval service via SURBs

   Proper implementation and use of the Sphinx packet format should
   prevent tagging and replay attacks.

   Denial of service does not necessarily lead to compromised
   anonymity or location hiding properties but it is broad category of
   attack for which we have only partial defenses. For example,
   Providers can rate limit their client's ingress traffic. Each
   Provider can also rate limit the total traffic it sends into the
   mixnet. On the other hand connected clients may be able to fill up
   each other's Provider mailbox. If any kind of open registration
   mechanism is used then this also lends itself to abuse.

3.3 The PANDA Kaetzchen Service

   User key exchanges are done using the PANDA protocol [PANDA]
   implemented as a Katzenpost Provider side autoresponder
   service. [KATZPANDA] [KAETZCHEN] This means that bidirectional
   interaction with the PANDA service is done using the mix network
   transport for several advantages:

      * client to server unlinkability: Prevent sufficiently global
        adversaries from learning which PANDA server a given client is
        interacting with. Prevent sufficiently global adversaries from
        learning which clients are interacting with a given PANDA server.

      * mix PANDA protocol messages with other types of traffic

      * sender and receiver unobservability of server

      * sender and receiver unobservability of client

      * location hiding properties for clients

4. Packet Format

   An alternate parameterization of the Sphinx cryptographic packet
   format is not specified here but could be constructed if
   needed. One possible reason would be to avoid using AEZ as the wide
   block cipher to make it easier to write implementation in another
   language.

5. Bidirectional Communication Message Channels

   Bidirectional communication partnerships are first established
   using the [PANDA] protocol to faciliate a [SIGNAL] handshake AND
   the exchange of dead drop descriptors. Each client uses one dead
   drop per contact. There is no universal naming scheme hence the
   namesake of this document. Like Petmail and Pond, clients choose
   the name for each of their contacts.

   Before participation in the PANDA protocol the client registers a new
   dead drop and creates a new Signal double ratchet session for use
   with the new contact. Clients MUST exchange fresh dead drop
   descriptors before old ones expire.
