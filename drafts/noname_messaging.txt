Noname Message Protocol Specification
David Stainton

Version 0

Abstract

   This document describes the Noname message protocol which is
   specifically designed to provide strong location hiding properties,
   tunable resistance to longterm statistical disclosure attacks and
   resistance to some active attacks. This mix network protocol
   essentially provides to clients reliable bidirectional communication
   channels. It can be used to construct messaging applications.

1. Introduction

   This specification is inspired by Pond and Petmail [POND] [PETMAIL]
   and also uses many designs from the mix network literature,
   especially the [LOOPIX], Katzenpost [KATZMIXNET] and [MIXMINION]
   systems. Compared to Katzenpost the system I describe here has a
   server side that is almost exactly the same except for the addition
   of several Provider-side mixnet services. [KAETZCHEN]

   This protocol uses [PANDA] to exchange channel setup information
   between clients, this information includes public keys for
   encryption AND descriptors of unidirectional dead drops
   [KATZDEADDROP]. We use the exchange of unidirectional channels to
   form bidirectional channels. We exchange multiple dead drop
   descriptors for reliability purposes. The highest protocol
   presentation specified here is that of a reliable or optionally
   unreliable client to client bidirection communication channel.

   This document is meant to be read with the accompanying
   specification documents:

      * [KATZMIXNET] - Katzenpost Mix Network Specification

      * [KATZDECOY] - Katzenpost Mix Network Decoy Traffic Specification

      * [KATZMIXPKI] - Katzenpost Mix Network Public Key
        Infrastructure Specification

      * [KATZMIXWIRE] - Katzenpost Mix Network Wire Protocol Specification

      * [KAETZCHEN] - Katzenpost Provider-side Autoresponder Extension

      * [KATZDEADDROP] - Katzenpost Dead Drop Extension

1.1 Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2 Terminology

   * ARQ - Automatic Repeat reQuest, a protocol scheme which
     uses ACKnowledgement messages AND retransmissions to achieve
     end to end reliability.

   * PANDA - Phrase Automated Nym Discovery Authentication; a
     variation of a Password Authenticated Key Exchange where clients
     have identical behavior and perform their message exchanges
     asynchronously with a simple server which enforces two message
     slots per "meeting place". See [PANDA] and [PANDASPEC] for details.

   * SURB - Single Use Reply Block is a cryptographic delivery
     token which was first introduced by the Mixminion design
     [MIXMINION] and revised by the Sphinx cryptographic packet format.
     See [SPHINX] and [SPHINXSPEC] for details.

1.3 Differences From The Katzenpost Messaging System

   * Herein I describe a protocol not a messaging system. We therefore
   do not concern ourselves with the end to end encryption but provide
   a cryptographic transport. Confidentiality and message integrity are
   protected using the link layer [KATZMIXWIRE] and sphinx encryption
   layers. [SPHINX] [SPHINXSPEC]

   * There is no universal naming scheme or inherent SPAM problem, rather
   clients are responsible for exchanging the channel initialization
   information.

2. System Overview

   Mixminion introduced the Single Use Reply Block, also known as a
   SURB which is a single-use cryptographic delivery token for latent
   message delivery. SURBs have a relatively short lifetime because
   they are essentially a mixnet packet header which is encrypted with
   the routing keys of several mixes and therefore expires when any of
   the mixes rotate their key.

   In the Katzenpost system this key rotation epoch is every 3
   hours. [KATZMIXPKI] It is NOT desirable to have long lived mix
   routing keys because this increases the time allowance of
   compulsion attacks. We conclude that SURBs are NOT suitable for
   establishing a bidirectional communication channel for clients that
   frequently go offline for time durations greater than the mix key
   rotation epoch.

   Instead a Katzenpost autoresponder [KAETZCHEN] based dead drop
   [KATZDEADDROP] service can be used.  Unlike SURBs dead drop
   descriptors do not have any inherent expiration. However, for the
   purpose of reducing exposure to longterm statistical disclosure
   attacks, these descriptors shall specify an expiration. The
   expiration specifies how far into the future the receiver promises
   to check for messages in the dead drop queue. Client communication
   partners MUST periodically exchange new dead drop descriptors
   before the old dead drop descriptors expire.

3. Threat Model

3.1 Security Goals

   This specification document describes a messaging system with
   the following security goals:

      * strong location hiding properties: The system MUST NOT give
        Bob enough information to easily find Alice's location AND if
        a compulsion attack is used it MUST require compromising more
        than one mixnet node.

      * sender and receiver anonymity with respect to third party
        observers: Bob and Alice send each other messages while being
        certain of who will receive the messages AND while not hiding
        their identity to the receiver. However, third party observers
        will NOT be able to determine that they are even communicating
        with each other.

      * receiver unobservability: Receivers receive decoy traffic and
        legit traffic thereby creating uncertainty for passive network
        observers.

      * sender unobservability: Senders send decoy and legit traffic
      thereby creating uncertainly for passive network observers.

   We shall now proceed with Brian Warner's mode of analysis and
   quote several security goals from the [PETMAIL] document :

      """
      * S0: Two different senders cannot tell if they're talking to the
        same recipient or not.

      * M0: The mailbox server cannot tell which message came from which
        sender, not even that two messages came from the same sender, nor
        can it determine how many senders might be configured for each
        recipient.

      * R0: The recipient can use the transport information to accurately
        identify the sender.

      * Rev0: R can revoke one sender without involving the remaining ones.
      """

   Our security goals in short form are expressed as:

      S0 M0 R0 Rev0

4. Protocol Description

Each client performs the [PANDA] protocol exchange using
their shared passphrase. This allows clients to establish
a Single Double Ratchet connection using Katzenpost dead drops.

Our four point protocol plan is as follows:

1. register a remote mailbox as the dead drop for the new contact

2. create signal double ratchet keys and compose a dead drop descriptor

3. perform the PANDA exchange

4. send and receive messages


X. Future Work

   * a more formal security analysis

   * Post Quantum double ratchet instead of Signal Double Ratchet

   * can we use Sphinc-256 signatures for anything? ;-p
