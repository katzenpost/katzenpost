.. rubric:: Abstract

This document describes the message dead drop service. The dead drop
service can be used to compose messaging systems with stronger
location hiding properties, and increased resistance to longterm
statistical disclosure attacks also known as intersection attacks.

1. Introduction
===============

The dead drop service is implemented as a Provider side
autoresponder service [KAETZCHEN]_, it provides clients with the
ability to retrieve messages from remote Providers. This
unidirectional dead drop scheme should leak less information than a
bidirectional dead drop. This document does not describe the full
design of a message system. Instead we merely specify a mixnet dead
drop service which can be one of many design elements used to
compose a messaging system.

-------------------------------------

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]_.

1.2 Terminology
---------------

``Provider`` - A service, operated by a third party, that Clients
communicate directly with to communicate with the Mixnet. It is
responsible for Client authentication, forwarding outgoing
messages to the Mixnet, and storing incoming messages for the
Client. The Provider MUST have the ability to perform
cryptographic operations on the relayed messages.

``SURB`` - Single Use Reply Block is a cryptographic delivery
token which was first introduced by the Mixminion design
[MIXMINION]_ and revised by the Sphinx cryptographic packet format.
[SPHINX]_  [SPHINXSPEC]_

2. Overview
===========

A client possessing the dead drop address sends a message to a dead
drop just like a normal Katzenpost message [KATZMIXE2E]_. However
the receiver of the message uses the dead drop Kaetzchen service to
retrieve messages by sending one or more SURBs to the dead drop.

Consider this diagram where Alice sends a message to Bob's spool on
his remote Provider:

At a latter time, Bob sends a SURB to his remote Provider to retrieve
a message from his spool:

   :alt: diagram 6
   :align: center


The messages return trip from remote Provider to Bob's local Provider
can look like this:

Finally, Bob retrieves the message from his local Provider:

3. Protocol Messages
====================

The DeadDropRequest is sent to the dead drop service with a SURB
that is used to send the DeadDropResponse back to the client.

3.1 DeadDropRequest message
---------------------------

Dead drop requests are authenticated by the Provider's user
authentication database similar to how Katzenpost Providers
authenticate client wire protocol connections, as detailed in [KATZMIXWIRE]_
and  [KATZMIXE2E]_. In this case, we are coupling the User and AuthToken
fields in the DeadDropRequest to provide the needed authentication
information.

::

       {
           "Version": 0,
           "User": "Alice",
           "AuthToken": "yczzyO30cLKtoh/BDAOfyIDjb6nwe6l/ebuVDDhN+Q8boxB7SHG8IS4NFp62LEZg",
           "Ack": 0
       }


* The User field is a string which the Provider associates with a
  X25519 public key AND a message spool.

* The AuthToken field is a base64 encoded ciphertext blob produced by
  encrypting a zero length payload with
  `Noise_K_25519_ChaChaPoly_Blake2b` using the user's link key,
  which the Katzenpost system uses for link layer authentication
  [KATZMIXWIRE]_.

The encrypted and authenticated blob has the following structure:

::

       // XXX Correct?

       struct {
           /* Noise protocol fields. */
           opaque noise_e[32];     /* The Noise handshake `e`. */
           opaque noise_mac[16];   /* The Noise ciphertext MAC. */
       } BlockCiphertext;


* The Ack field defaults to zero unless the user has had a previous
  interaction where a DeadDropResponse was received. In that case the
  previously received Sequence numbers are placed into this Ack field
  which causes the deaddrop service to purge the associated messages.

3.2. DeadDropResponse message
-----------------------------

::

      {
         "Version": 0,
         "StatusCode": 0,
         "QueueHint": 0,
         "Sequence": 0,
         "Payload": ""
      }

* The StatusCode field is used to report errors to the client if any.
  Valid status codes are:

  ::

      enum {
         status_ok(0),           /* No error condition. It SHOULD be
                                    accompanied with a valid message payload. */
         status_syntax_error(1), /* The request was malformed. */
         status_no_identity(2),  /* No such identity was found. */
         status_auth_error(3),   /* Authentication failure. */
      } StatusCodes;


* QueueHint is used to inform the client how many more messages are
  queued.

* Sequence is used by the server to decide when to permanently
  delete a message. When the next request message is received
  containing this sequence number then the associated message is
  purged.

* Payload is used to encapsulate one or more messages.

4. Dead Drop Descriptor
=======================

Dead drop descriptors can be exchanged between clients to establish
communication channels.

::

      {
        "Version": 0,
        "TimeoutUnixEpoch": 12345,
        "DeadDropAddress": "fe37a524ce6410a59718@provider-0.example.org"
      }

* The TimeoutUnixEpoch field is used to specify the timeout in Unix
  epoch format.

* The DeadDropAddress field is used to specify the dead drop slot
  on the remote Provider.

5. Anonymity Considerations
===========================

* Collusion of Providers might make it possible to link an account
  on two different Providers. That is, given user's dead drop, an attacker
  can discover if the two Providers collude. However, this linkage
  may require a longterm statistical disclosure attack. In that case,
  these longterm attacks might not converge on success if deaddrops
  are rotated frequently enough.

* Sending a deaddrop request with many bundled SURBs
  increases exposure to compulsion attack by the remote Provider.

* Sending a deaddrop request with many bundled SURBs exposes the
  client to a potential active confirmation attack where the remote
  Provider uses all of the SURBs to send messages concurrently. The
  adversary then tries to determine if there is an observed
  confirmation on the network exposing the destination of these
  SURB reply messages. In the [LOOPIX]_ Provider model the attacker
  might try to determine if any of the Providers receive slightly
  more messages. If the adversary has compromised one or more
  Providers, then the goal would be to determine if one message
  spool receives more messages than the rest.

* Client retransmissions can be predictable behavior which allows
  for active confirmation attacks which can discover the client's
  Provider. Consider for instance Alice and Bob where Alice is a
  powerful adversary that wishes to discover Bob's Provider. Alice
  compromises the server which hosts Bob's dead drop service.
  Alice knows when Bob sends a Message Retrieval command. In
  response to these Message Retrieval commands Alice then blocks
  one or more Providers and sends the response to the client using
  the supplied SURB. If another Message Retrieval command is
  received, it is likely that this retransmission confirms that the
  SURB Response was not received by the client because of blocking
  messages to one or more Providers. Alice uses these active
  confirmation attacks in a binary search to quickly discover Bob's
  Provider.

6. Security Considerations
==========================

* End to end message integrity and confidentiality from client to
  Provider is ensured by the Sphinx cryptographic packet format.

* The dead drop service authenticates message retrieval requests
  using a cryptographic token produced using the one-way Noise
  pattern *K*, in the construction `Noise_K_25519_ChaChaPoly_Blake2b`.

7. Future Work
==============

It should be possible to increase the communication channel
efficiency by sending DeadDropRequest messages supplied with
multiple SURBs. However, this must be carefully balanced with the
resulting exposure to statistical disclosure and compulsion
attacks.
