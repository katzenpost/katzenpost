Katzenpost mixnet PANDA service
===============================

This is a rough draft untested in memory PANDA service plugin. PANDA
stands for Phrase Automated Nym Discovery Authentication, which is a
protocol variation of EKE2, a PAKE, Password Authenticated Key
Exchange, with some design variations that allows clients to perform
the key exchanges asynchronously using a ciphertext intermediary, this
PANDA server. That is to say, this server is simple a merely
facilitates the exchanges of cryphtographic binary blobs between
clients participating in the PANDA protocol.
