PANDA Library
=============

PANDA stands for Phrase Automated Nym Discovery Authentication, which
is a protocol variation of EKE2, a PAKE, Password Authenticated Key
Exchange, with some design variations that allows clients to perform
the key exchanges asynchronously using a ciphertext intermediary.


Status
======

This is currently in a draft development state due to
pending feature addition to our mix server library to add
a mixnet service plugin system.
