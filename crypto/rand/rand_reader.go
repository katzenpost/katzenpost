// At least as of Go 1.6.1,  Go's crypto/rand does some horrific bullshit that
// defeats the point of getrandom(2), namedly, it cowardly refuses to use the
// syscall based entropy source if it would have blocked on the first call.
//
// This is rather suboptimal.  The correct thing to do for something named
// "crypto/rand" is to fucking BLOCK if the entropy pool isn't there and not
// to pull poor quality entropy by falling back to doing blocking reads on
// "/dev/urandom".
//
// This was brought up in https://github.com/golang/go/issues/11833
// and dismissed, I think they're wrong, I'm fixing it on common systems
// that I care about.
//
// Upstream has seen the errors of their ways and fixed this as of Go 1.9
// (See: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/19274), but that isn't guaranteed
// to be everywhere, and there's an advantage to whitening the output anyway.
