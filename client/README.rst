Katzenpost Mix Network Client Library
=====================================

This client library is general purpose in the sense that it can be used to
build arbitrarily complex messaging systems using Katzenpost. However note that
right now it only supports strict SURB based query response protocols to
interactive mix network services. These services can be written in any langauge
and plugged into the Providers. Furthermore this client does not yet perform
any retransmissions if a packet gets dropped by the mix network.

travis tests

Our gitlab tests are located here:

https://gitlab.techcultivation.org/katzenpost/client/-/jobs


optional docker tests

To run the optional docker tests firstly, see our docker repo
and start your local dockerized mix network:
