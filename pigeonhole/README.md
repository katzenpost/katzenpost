# Katzenpost Mix Network Map Library

This library is provided for making an ephemeral read-write capability-based
storage system for Katzenpost, so that clients may exchange capabilities to
read and write storage locations in order to establish asynchronous end-to-end
communication channels.

It consists of a Katzenpost Kaetzchen plugin service and a corresponding
client library that can be used to read and write data to this service.

## unit tests

Unit tests are run using go test:

```bash
go test -v ./...
```

## GitHub CI tests

End-to-End tests are run using dockerized instances of the Katzenpost mixnet.

To start a locally running testnet, navigate to the docker directory of this
repository and follow the README.rst to familiarize yourself with starting and
stopping a local mixnet using the make commands.

Once you have a mixnet running, e.g.:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/katzenpost/katzenpost -b add_reliable_streams && cd katzenpost/docker && make start wait
```

You can then run the end-to-end tests like so:

```bash
  cd ../katzenpost/map && make dockerdockertest
```
