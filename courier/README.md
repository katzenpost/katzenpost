# Pigeonhole Courier Service

This section of code implements the "courier service" from our
unpublished paper, **Echomix: a Strong Anonymity System with
Messaging** which you can read here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02933

The "courier" services which operates on the service nodes in the mix
network, is responsible for proxying queries and replies to and from
the storage replicas.
