Katzenpost Mix Network Public Key Infrastructure
================================================

Overview
--------

This is essentially a single point of failure. If this PKI system becomes
compromised by an adversary it's game over for anonymity and security
guarantees. Consider using the voting authority instead.

The Katzenpost voting Directory Authority system is a replacement for
the non-voting Directory Authority. However it's votiing protocol is
NOT byzantine fault tolerant. Therefore a Directory Authority server
which is participating in the voting protocol can easily perform a
denial of service attack for each voting round. This would cause the
mix network to become totally unusable.

All Katzenpost PKI systems have two essential components:

* a client library
* server infrastructure

Furthermore this client library has two types of users, namely mixes
and clients. That is, mixes must use the library to upload/download
their mix descriptors and clients use the library to download a
network consensus document so that they can route messages through the
mix network.


Install
-------

See the authority readme:

* https://github.com/katzenpost/authority


Configuration
-------------

A sample configuration file can be found in our docker repository, here:

* https://github.com/katzenpost/docker


CLI usage of The Non-voting Directory Authority
-----------------------------------------------

The non-voting authority has the following commandline usage::

   ./nonvoting --help
   Usage of ./nonvoting:
     -f string
           Path to the authority config file. (default "katzenpost-authority.toml")
     -g    Generate the keys and exit immediately.


The ``-g`` option is used to generate the public and private keys for
the Directory Authority.  Clients of the PKI will use this public key
to verify retrieved network consensus documents.  However before
invoking the authority with this commandline option you MUST provide a
valid configuration file. This file will specify a data directory
where these keys will be written.  Normal invocation will omit this
``-g`` option because the keypair should already be present.

A minimal configuration suitable for using with this ``-g`` option for
generating the key pair looks like this::

  [Authority]
  Addresses = [ "192.0.2.1:12345" ]
  DataDir = "/var/run/katzauth"

Example invocation commandline::

   ./nonvoting -g -f my_authority_config.toml

However the invocation may fail if the permissions on the data directory
are not restricted to the owning user::

   ./nonvoting -g -f my_authority_config.toml
   Failed to spawn authority instance: authority: DataDir '/var/run/katzauth' has invalid permissions 'drwxr-xr-x'

Fix permissions like so::

   chmod 700 /var/run/katzauth

A successful run will print output that looks like this::

  14:47:43.141 NOTI authority: Katzenpost is still pre-alpha.  DO NOT DEPEND ON IT FOR STRONG SECURITY OR ANONYMITY.
  14:47:43.142 NOTI authority: Authority identity public key is: 375F00F6EA20ACFB3F4CDCA7FDB50AE427BF02035B6A2F5789281DAA7290B2BB

Note that if you choose to configure logging to a file one disk, you
can implement log rotation by moving the log file and then sending the
``HUP`` to the authority server process. This will cause the daemon to
rewrite the log file in the location specified by the config file.


Configuring The Non-voting Directory Authority
----------------------------------------------

Authority section
`````````````````

The Authority section contains information which is mandatory,
for example::

  [Authority]
    Addresses = [ "192.0.2.1:29483", "[2001:DB8::1]:29483" ]
    DataDir = "/var/lib/katzenpost-authority"

* ``Addresses`` contains one or more IP addresses which
  correspond to local network interfaces to listen for connections on.
  These can be specified as IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.

* ``DataDir`` specifies the absolute path to the server's
  state files including the keypair use to sign network consensus
  documents.


Logging section
```````````````

The logging section controls the logging, for example::

  [Logging]
    Disable = false
    File = "/var/log/katzenpost.log"
    Level = "DEBUG"

* ``Disable`` is used to disable logging if set to ``true``.

* ``File`` specifies the file to log to. If omitted then stdout is used.

* ``Debug`` may be set to one of the following:

* ERROR
* WARNING
* NOTICE
* INFO
* DEBUG


Parameters section
``````````````````

The Parameters section holds the network parameters, for example::

  [Parameters]
    SendRatePerMinute = 30
    Mu = 0.00025
    MuMaxDelay = 9000
    LambdaP = 15.0
    SendShift = 3
    LambdaPMaxDelay = 3000
    LambdaL = 0.00025
    LambdaLMaxDelay = 9000
    LambdaD = 0.00025
    LambdaDMaxDelay = 9000
    LambdaM = 0.00025
    LambdaMMaxDelay = 9000

* ``SendRatePerMinute`` is the rate limiter maximum allowed rate of
  packets per client.

* ``Mu`` is the inverse of the mean of the exponential
  distribution that the Sphinx packet per-hop mixing delay will be
  sampled from.

* ``MuMaxDelay`` is the maximum Sphinx packet per-hop mixing
  delay in milliseconds.

* ``LambdaP``  LambdaP is the inverse of the mean of the exponential distribution
  that **clients** will sample to determine the time interval between sending
  messages from it's FIFO egress queue or drop decoy messages if the queue
  is empty.

* ``LambdaPMaxDelay`` is the maximum send interval for LambdaP in milliseconds

* ``LambdaL`` LambdaL is the inverse of the mean of the exponential distribution
  that **clients** will sample to determine the time interval between sending
  decoy loop messages.

* ``LambdaLMaxDelay`` sets the maximum send interval for LambdaL in milliseconds.

* ``LambdaD`` is the inverse of the mean of the exponential distribution
  that **clients** will sample to determine the time interval between sending
  decoy drop messages.

* ``LambdaDMaxDelay`` is the maximum send interval in milliseconds.

* ``LambdaM`` is the inverse of the mean of the exponential distribution that
  **mixes** will sample to determine send timing of mix loop decoy traffic.

* ``LambdaMMaxDelay`` sets the maximum delay for LambdaM


Mixes section
`````````````

The Mixes array defines the list of white-listed non-provider nodes,
for example::

  [[Mixes]]
  IdentityKey = "kAiVchOBwHVtKJVFJLsdCQ9UyN2SlfhLHYqT8ePBetg="

  [[Mixes]]
  IdentityKey = "900895721381C0756D28954524BB1D090F54C8DD9295F84B1D8A93F1E3C17AD8"


* ``IdentityKey`` is the node's EdDSA signing key, in either Base16 OR Base64 format.


Provider section
````````````````

The Providers array defines the list of white-listed Provider nodes,
for example::

  [[Providers]]
  Identifier = "provider1"
  IdentityKey = "0AV1syaCdBbm3CLmgXLj6HdlMNiTeeIxoDc8Lgk41e0="

  [[Providers]]
  Identifier = "provider2"
  IdentityKey = "375F00F6EA20ACFB3F4CDCA7FDB50AE427BF02035B6A2F5789281DAA7290B2BB"


* ``Identifier`` is the human readable provider identifier, such as a
  FQDN.

* ``IdentityKey`` is the provider's EdDSA signing key, in either
  Base16 OR Base64 format.
