Katzenpost Mix Server Infrastructure
====================================

Overview
--------

A Katzenpost Provider is strictly a superset of the Katzenpost mix.
Both of these components are provided for by the ``server`` binary.
Each Provider and Mix MUST be white-listed by the Directory Authority (PKI)
in order to participate in the network.

Install
-------

See the mix server readme:

* https://github.com/katzenpost/server


Configuration
-------------

A sample configuration file can be found in our docker repository, here:

* https://github.com/katzenpost/docker


``server`` Commandline Usage
----------------------------

The ``server`` commandline usage is as follows::

  ./server -h
  Usage of ./server:
    -f string
          Path to the server config file. (default "katzenpost.toml")
    -g    Generate the keys and exit immediately.


The command output when generating keys looks like this::

  ./server -f my_katzenpost_mix_server.toml -g
  22:51:55.377 NOTI server: Katzenpost is still pre-alpha.  DO NOT DEPEND ON IT FOR STRONG SECURITY OR ANONYMITY.
  22:51:55.377 NOTI server: AEZv5 implementation is hardware accelerated.
  22:51:55.377 NOTI server: Server identifier is: 'example.com'
  22:51:55.379 NOTI server: Server identity public key is: 2628F87F2806048C95F060DA9CD3D8F9BE7550BFB9EE85F213381BC04C047650
  22:51:55.379 NOTI server: Server link public key is: CCDC5C105E649D543DF1CF397A17638F812F95B7E572288F4602F8EC01EC4F3C


Note that if you choose to configure logging to a file one disk, you
can implement log rotation by moving the log file and then sending the
``HUP`` to the authority server process. This will cause the daemon to
rewrite the log file in the location specified by the config file.


Configuring Mixes and Providers
-------------------------------

Katzenpost mixes and providers have identical configuration files
except that the configuration for a provider has a ``Provider`` section
AND the ``Server`` section specifies ``IsProvider = true``.

Server section
``````````````

The Server section contains mandatory information common to all nodes,
for example::

  [Server]
    Identifier = "example.com"
    Addresses = [ "192.0.2.1:29483", "[2001:DB8::1]:29483" ]
    DataDir = "/var/lib/katzenpost"
    IsProvider = true

* ``Identifier`` is the human readable identifier for the node (eg:
  FQDN).

* ``Addresses`` are the IP address/port combinations that the server
  will bind to for incoming connections. IPv4 and/or IPv6 may be
  specified.

* ``DataDir`` is the absolute path to the server's state files.

* ``IsProvider`` specifies if the server is a provider (vs a mix).


PKI section
```````````

The PKI section contains the directory authority configuration
for the given mix or provider, for example::

  [PKI]
    [PKI.Nonvoting]
      Address = "192.0.2.2:2323"
      PublicKey = "kAiVchOBwHVtKJVFJLsdCQ9UyN2SlfhLHYqT8ePBetg="

* ``Nonvoting`` is a simple non-voting PKI for test deployments.

* ``Address`` is the IP address/port combination of the directory authority.

* ``PublicKey`` is the directory authority's public key in Base64 or Base16 format.


Logging section
```````````````

The Logging section controls the logging, for example::

  [Logging]
    Disable = false
    File = "/var/log/katzenpost.log"
    Level = "DEBUG"

* ``Disable`` is used to disable logging if set to ``true``.

* ``File`` specifies the file to log to. If omitted then stdout is used.

* ``Debug`` may be set to one of the following:

* ERROR
* WARNING
* NOTICE
* INFO
* DEBUG

**Warning: The `DEBUG` log level is unsafe for production use.**


Management section
``````````````````

The management section specifies connectivity information for the
Katzenpost control protocol which can be used to make configuration
changes during run-time. An example configuration looks like this::

  [Management]

    Enable = true
    Path = "/var/lib/katzenpost/thwack.sock"

* ``Disable`` is used to disable the management interface if set to
  ``true``.

* ``Path`` specifies the path to the management interface socket. If
  left empty then `management_sock` will be used under the DataDir.


Debug section
`````````````

Debug is the Katzenpost server debug configuration
for advanced tuning.

* ``IdentityKey`` specifies the identity private key.

* ``NumSphinxWorkers`` specifies the number of worker instances to use for
  inbound Sphinx packet processing.

* ``NumProviderWorkers`` specifies the number of worker instances to use for
  provider specific packet processing.

* ``NumKaetzchenWorkers`` specifies the number of worker instances to use for
  Kaetzchen specific packet processing.

* ``SchedulerExternalMemoryQueue`` will enable the experimental external
  memory queue that is backed by d`isk.

* ``SchedulerQueueSize`` is the maximum allowed scheduler queue size before
  random entries will start getting dropped.  A value <= 0 is treated
  as unlimited.

* ``SchedulerMaxBurst`` is the maximum number of packets that will be
  dispatched per scheduler wakeup event.

* ``UnwrapDelay`` is the maximum allowed unwrap delay due to queueing in
  milliseconds.

* ``ProviderDelay`` is the maximum allowed provider delay due to queueing
  in milliseconds.

* ``KaetzchenDelay`` is the maximum allowed kaetzchen delay due to queueing
  in milliseconds.

* ``SchedulerSlack`` is the maximum allowed scheduler slack due to queueing
  and or processing in milliseconds.

* ``SendSlack`` is the maximum allowed send queue slack due to queueing and
  or congestion in milliseconds.

* ``DecoySlack`` is the maximum allowed decoy sweep slack due to various
  external delays such as latency before a loop decoy packet will
  be considered lost.

* ``ConnectTimeout`` specifies the maximum time a connection can take to
  establish a TCP/IP connection in milliseconds.

* ``HandshakeTimeout`` specifies the maximum time a connection can take for a
  link protocol handshake in milliseconds.

* ``ReauthInterval`` specifies the interval at which a connection will be
  reauthenticated in milliseconds.

* ``SendDecoyTraffic`` enables sending decoy traffic.  This is still
  experimental and untuned and thus is disabled by default.
  WARNING: This option will go away once decoy traffic is more concrete.

* ``DisableRateLimit`` disables the per-client rate limiter.  This option
  should only be used for testing.

* ``GenerateOnly`` halts and cleans up the server right after long term
  key generation.


Provider section
````````````````

The Provider section specifies the Provider configuration.
This section of the configuration has sensible defaults for
every field and can therefore be omitted unless you wish
to deviate from the defaults.

The top-level Provider configuration parameters include:

* ``EnableUserRegistrationHTTP`` if set to ``true`` then the HTTP
  registration service will be enabled and the
  ``UserRegistrationHTTPAddresses`` option must also be set.

* ``UserRegistrationHTTPAddresses`` is set to a list of TCP addresses
  which include the IP address of the interface to listen on and the
  TCP port.

* ``BinaryRecipients`` if set to ``true`` disables all Provider side
  recipient pre-processing, including removing trailing `NUL` bytes,
  case normalization, and delimiter support.

* ``CaseSensitiveRecipients`` if set to ``true`` disables recipient
  case normalization. If left unset, all user names will be converted
  to lower case.

* ``RecipientDelimiter`` is the set of characters that separates a user name
  from it's extension (eg: `alice+foo`).

* ``AltAddresses`` is the map of extra transports and addresses at which
  the Provider is reachable by clients.  The most useful alternative
  transport is likely ("tcp") (`core/pki.TransportTCP`).


Provider HTTP Registration
``````````````````````````

Here's an example TOML configuration section that demonstrates how to
configure a HTTP Registration service that facilitates account
registration::

   [Provider]

     EnableUserRegistrationHTTP = true
     UserRegistrationHTTPAddresses = [ "127.0.0.1:8080"]


**Warning**

This configuration example configures the HTTP registration service to
listen on the loopback interface on TCP port 8080. There is NO authentication,
TLS encryption or abuse mitigation at all; this is left as an exercise for
the discerning systems administrator who can utilize some kind of proxy
service to mitigate abuse and provide TLS authentication.


Kaetzchen Configuration
'''''''''''''''''''''''

``Kaetzchen`` are a simple kind of Provider-side service which
receives a request and replies with a response message. We here
discuss built-in internal kaetzchen services. (see next section for
external kaetzchen plugin system)

Consider the following simple configuration example where we configure
the loop and keyserver services::

  [Provider]

    [[Provider.Kaetzchen]]
      Capability = "loop"
      Endpoint = "+loop"
      Disable = false

    [[Provider.Kaetzchen]]
      Capability = "keyserver"
      Endpoint = "+keyserver"
      Disable = false

The ``Kaetzchen`` field is the list of configured Kaetzchen
(auto-responder agents) for this provider. In the above example we
configured two Kaetzchen, keyserver and loop which are required
by the mailproxy client.

Lets review the Kaetzchen configuration parameters:

* ``Capability`` is the capability exposed by the agent.

* ``Endpoint`` is the provider side endpoint that the agent will accept
  requests at. While not required by the spec, this server only
  supports Endpoints that are lower-case local-parts of an e-mail
  address. By convention these endpoint strings begin with ``+``.

* ``Config`` is the extra per agent arguments to be passed to the agent's
  initialization routine.

* ``Disable`` disabled a configured agent.


External Kaetzchen Plugin Configuration
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Currently the Katzenpost server external kaetzchen plugin system
uses CBOR over HTTP over UNIX domain socket to communicate with plugin programs.
That is to say, the katzenpost server will spin up each plugin program
one or more times as specified by it's ``MaxConcurrency`` parameter,
connect to it as a HTTP client and pipeline Kaetzchen queries.

Here's a configuration example for the external currency service
::

  [[Provider.CBORPluginKaetzchen]]
  Capability = "zec"
  Endpoint = "+zec"
  Disable = false
  Command = "/home/user/test_mixnet/bin/currency"
  MaxConcurrency = 10
  [Provider.PluginKaetzchen.Config]
    log_dir = "/home/user/test_mixnet/zec_tx_logs"
    f = "/home/user/test_mixnet/currency_zec/curreny.toml"

We've written echo services in golang and rust as an example here:
https://github.com/katzenpost/server_plugins


Provider User Database Configuration
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

``UserDB`` is the user database configuration.  If left empty the simple
BoltDB backed user database will be used with the default database. A simple
configuration example::

  [Provider.UserDB]
    Backend = "bolt"

    [Provider.UserDB.Bolt]
      UserDB = "my_users.db"


* ``Backend`` is the active userdb backend. If left empty, the BoltUserDB
  backend will be used (`bolt`).

If the ``bolt`` backend is specified there is one configuration parameter
available under this section:

* ``UserDB`` is the path to the user database. If left empty it will use
  `users.db` under the DataDir.


Next we will examine a configuration example which demonstrates using
a user database via HTTP::

    [Provider.UserDB]
      [Provider.UserDB.ExternUserDB]
        ProviderURL = "http://localhost:8080/"

* ``ExternUserDB`` is the external http user authentication mechanism.

* ``ProviderURL`` is the base url used for the external provider authentication API.


Provider Spool Database Configuration
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The Provider spool database stores received messages for later
retreival by clients. A simple configuration example follows::

  [Provider.SpoolDB]
    Backend = "bolt"

    [Provider.SpoolDB.Bolt]
      SpoolDB = "my_spool.db"

* ``SpoolDB`` is the path to the user message spool. If left empty, it
  will default to `spool.db` under the DataDir.


Using the Postgres SQL Database Backend
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Lastly, we will explore how to use a SQL database as the backend for the
user and spool databases, for example::

  [Provider]
    [Provider.SQLDB]
      Backend = "pgx"
      DataSourceName = "postgresql://provider:s3cr3tp0stgr355@127.0.0.1:5433/katzenpost"
    [Provider.SpoolDB]
      Backend = "sql"
    [Provider.UserDB]
      Backend = "sql"

This configuration sample demonstrates how to use a Postgres database
for both the user database and the spool database. The ``Backend`` parameter
is set to ``pgx`` which means "use a postgresql database".

* ``DataSourceName`` is the SQL data source name or URI. The format
  of this parameter is dependent on the database driver being used.


Setup the Postgres SQL database backend:

0. Install postgres
   Postgres 9.5 or later is required. On a debian
   system you can install it like so::

     apt install postgresql

1. Configure postgres access
   The pg_hba.conf file is the place to configure access to the
   databases. It's parsed from top to bottom, first matching rule is
   applied. You probably need to add a rule for your 'provider' user
   fairly early. On a debian system this file may be located here::

     /etc/postgresql/9.6/main/pg_hba.conf

   Start a shell as the postgres user. If you are superuser
   you can use su or sudo to start the shell as postgres like::

     sudo -u postgres

   or without sudo::

     su - postgres

   Add the database user "provider"::

     createuser -U postgres provider

   Add a database::

     createdb -U postgres -O provider katzenpost

   Start the postgres shell::

     psql

   Set the password for your new user::

     ALTER USER provider WITH PASSWORD 's3cr3tp0stgr355';

   Test to see if you can connect::

     psql -U provider -h 127.0.0.1 katzenpost

   If all goes fine, it's time to load the SQL, that creates the
   Katzenpost database schema and stored procedures::

     psql -U provider --password -d katzenpost -h 127.0.0.1 -f create_database-postgresql.sql

   That sql script is located in our ``server`` git repository, here:
   https://github.com/katzenpost/server/blob/master/internal/sqldb/create_database-postgresql.sql

2. Start the Katzenpost server.


Runtime configuration changes with the management socket
--------------------------------------------------------

The ``socat`` commandline utility can be use to connect to the management socket
and issue commands. Connect with a commandline like so::

   socat unix:/<path-to-data-dir>/management_sock STDOUT


The following commands are possible:

* ``QUIT`` - Exit this management socket session.

* ``SHUTDOWN`` - Cause the server to gracefully shutdown.

* ``ADD_USER`` - Add a user and associate it with the given link key in either hex or base64.
  The syntax of the command is as follows::

    ADD_USER alice X25519_public_key_in_hex_or_base64

* ``UPDATE_USER`` - Update the link key of a given user.
  The syntax of the command is as follows::

    UPDATE_USER alice X25519_public_key_in_hex_or_base64

* ``REMOVE_USER`` - Remove a given user.
  The syntax of the command is as follows::

    REMOVE_USER alice

* ``SET_USER_IDENTITY`` - Set a given user's identity key.
  The syntax of the command is as follows::

    SET_USER_IDENTITY alice X25519_public_key_in_hex_or_base64

* ``REMOVE_USER_IDENTITY`` - Remove a given user's identity key.
  MUST be called before removing the user with the ``REMOVE_USER`` command.
  The synx of this command is as follows::

    REMOVE_USER_IDENTITY alice

* ``USER_IDENTITY`` - Retrieve the identity key of the given user.
  The syntax of the command is as follows::

    USER_IDENTITY alice

* ``SEND_RATE`` - Sets the rate limiter to the given packets per minute rate.
  ::

     SEND_RATE 30

* ``SEND_BURST`` - Sets the rate limiter burst to the given maximum.
  ::

     SEND_BURST 4
