Torification of Katzenpost
**************************

.. rubric:: Abstract

Tor and mixnets provide orthogonal anonymity properties and therefore
it can be advantageous for clients to connect to their mixnet Provider
and Directory Authority service(s) over Tor onion services. This document
describes how to configure these services and a mailproxy client to use Tor
onion services.

2. Install a standlone Tor in Debian/Ubuntu: https://www.torproject.org/docs/debian.html.en


Mailproxy
---------

Here is a complete mailproxy configuration that uses only Tor onion services
for it's communication with the mix network:

::
   [Proxy]
     POP3Address = "127.0.0.1:2524"
     SMTPAddress = "127.0.0.1:2525"
     DataDir = "/home/user/.mailproxy"

   [Logging]
     Disable = false
     Level = "NOTICE"

   [NonvotingAuthority]
     [NonvotingAuthority.PlaygroundAuthority]
       Address = "lxqkz5d5e3pehagu.onion:61832"
       PublicKey = "o4w1Nyj/nKNwho5SWfAIfh7SMU8FRx52nMHGgYsMHqQ="

   [[Account]]
     User = "alice"
     Provider = "playground"
     ProviderKeyPin = "imigzI26tTRXyYLXujLEPI9QrNYOEgC4DElsFdP9acQ="
     Authority = "PlaygroundAuthority"

   [Management]
     Enable = false

   [UpstreamProxy]
     PreferedTransports = [ "onion" ]
     Type = "tor+socks5"
     Network = "tcp"
     Address = "127.0.0.1:9050"
