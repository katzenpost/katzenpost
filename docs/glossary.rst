    Traffic Analysis Resistance
        Traffic analysis resistance means hiding traffic metadata from
        passive network observers. Such metadata includes:

           * message sender
           * message receiver
           * size of the message
           * time of message transmission

    Mix
        A mix is the primary component used to compose a mix network.
        Mixes receive incoming messages, mix them via some specific
        mix strategy which incurs a delay and then output the messages
        after removing one layer of encryption. Bitwise unlinkability
        between input and output messages is achieved using the mix
        network cryptographic packet format. Mixes can also output
        their own decoy traffic which adds further entropy to the
        network as detailed in the Loopix paper.

    Mixnet
        Mixnet is short for mix network which is a network of
        :term:`mix`\ es.  Fundamentally a mix network is a lossy
        packet switching network whose primary purpose is to achieve
        traffic analysis resistant properties such as location hiding,
        sender anonymity etc. See our FAQ for more information.

    Node
        A :term:`Mix` or :term:`Provider` instance.

    User
        An agent controlling a :term:`Client` of the :term:`Katzenpost` system.

    Client
        Software run by the :term:`User` on its local device to participate
        in the :term:`Mixnet`.

    Provider
        In the context of Loopix/Katzenpost, a Provider is a node in
        the mix network which is responsible for authenticating
        :term:`Client`\s, forwarding messages to the rest of the mix
        network on behalf of :term:`Client`\s and queueing messages
        that can later be retrieved by :term:`Client`\s.

    PKI
       Stands for Public Key Infrastructure. In the context of :term:`Panoramix`
       is also known as the :term:`Mix Directory Authority service`.
       In :term:`Katzenpost`, :term:`Network Authority` or in short
       :term:`Authority` is the server responsible to provide the
       :term:`Mix Directory Authority service`.

       It is explained in more detail in :ref:`pki`

    Sphinx
      The Sphinx cryptographic packet format is now the defacto
      standard for mix networks. The Mixminion mix network
      used SURBs to achieve sender anonymity. Mixminion inspired the
      design of the Sphinx packet format.

    Katzenpost
      A mixnet design based on the :term:`Loopix` research with
      added message transport reliability using an :term:`ARQ`
      protocol scheme.

    Panoramix
        A project funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and
        innovation programme to research :term:`mixnet`\s for voting, statistics,
        and messaging, running from 2015 to 2019. See `panoramix-project.eu <https://panoramix-project.eu/>`_.

    Loopix
        The Loopix mixnet design is described in the paper `"The Loopix Anonymity
        System" published at USENIX 2017 <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.00536.pdf>`_.
        Loopix uses a collection of the best mix network designs to create a
        messaging system that has the property of sender and receiver anonymity
        with respect to third party observers. Loopix uses the :term:`Sphinx`
        cryptographic packet format, various kinds of :term:`decoy traffic` and
        a :term:`stratified mix topology`.

    ARQ
        ARQ means Automatic Repeat reQuest which is a protocol scheme
        that achieves reliability by means for ACKnowledgement
        protocol control messages and retransmissions. This concept
        comes from the packet switching network literature and is not
        generally associated with mix networks. There is no other way
        to achieve network reliability other than an ARQ scheme
        although there are many hybrid ARQ schemes for radio
        communication that use forward error correction for the
        purpose of performing retransmissions less frequently.

    Stop and Wait ARQ
        Stop and Wait ARQ is the simplest of all the ARQ protocol
        schemes. In the context of mix networks it also leaks the
        least amount of information. When comparing it to TCP, Stop
        and Wait ARQ has a congestion window of size one. This means
        that after a message is transmitted, a second message cannot
        be sent until the ACK for the first message is received. If
        the ACK message is not received within a particular time
        duration then the message is retransmitted.

    SURB

        SURB means Single Use Reply Block. SURBs are essentially a
        cryptographic delivery token with a short lifetime. In the
        :term:`Sphinx` packet format SURBs have two categories of components,
        those used by the creator and those used by the sender. When
        Alice creates a SURB, she retains a decryption token and a
        SURB ID. Alice gives Bob a Sphinx header and a payload
        encryption token. Bob can use the payload encryption token to
        encrypt his message. Bob then attaches the :term:`Sphinx` header to
        his ciphertext payload, thus forming a :term:`Sphinx` packet which he
        sends through the network. Bob cannot know the destination or
        route of this :term:`Sphinx` packet. Alice will receive the ciphertext
        payload and the SURB ID. She uses the SURB ID to identify
        which SURB decryption token to use for the ciphertext payload
        decryption.

        SURBs have a short lifetime because mixes MUST rotate Sphinx
        routing keys frequently as the primary method of achieving
        forward secrecy. The other reason routing keys must be rotated
        is because each mix retains a replay cache which stores a
        unique tag for each Sphinx packet that traverses it. This
        replay cache can only be flushed after a key rotation.

    Mixminion
        A mix network software project whose design has been inspirational to
        the Katzenpost design. For more information see <https://www.mixminion.net/>.
