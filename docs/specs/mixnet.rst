protocols and behavior required of mix nodes participating in the
Katzenpost Mix Network.

1. Introduction
===============

This specification provides the design of a mix network meant
provide an anonymous messaging protocol between clients and
public mixnet services.

Various system components such as client software, end to end
messaging protocols, Sphinx cryptographic packet format and wire
protocol are described in their own specification documents.

1.1 Terminology
----------------

* A ``KiB`` is defined as 1024 8 bit octets.

* ``Mixnet`` - A mixnet also known as a mix network is a network of
  mixes that can be used to build various privacy preserving
  protocols.

* ``Mix`` - A cryptographic router that is used to compose a mixnet.
  Mixes use a cryptographic operation on messages being routed which
  provides bitwise unlinkability with respect to input versus output
  messages.  Katzenpost is a decryption mixnet that uses the Sphinx
  cryptographic packet format.

* ``Node`` - A Mix. Client's are NOT considered nodes in the mix
  network.  However note that network protocols are often layered; in
  our design documents we describe "mixnet hidden services" which can
  be operated by mixnet clients. Therefore if you are using node in
  some adherence to methematical termonology one could conceivably
  designate a client as a node. That having been said, it would not be
  appropriate to the discussion of our core mixnet protocol to refer
  to the clients as nodes.

* ``Entry mix``, ``Entry node`` - An entry mix is a mix that has some
  additional features:
  1. An entry mix is always the first hop in routes where the message originates from a client.
  2. An entry mix authenticates client's direct connections via the mixnet's wire protocol.
  3. An entry mix queues reply messages and allows clients to retrieve them later.

* ``Service mix`` - A service mix is a mix that has some additional
  features:
  1. A service mix is always the last hop in routes where the message originates from a client.
  2. A service mix runs mixnet services which use a Sphinx SURB based protocol.

* ``User`` - An agent using the Katzenpost system.

* ``Client`` - Software run by the User on its local device to
  participate in the Mixnet. Again let us reiterate that a client
  is not considered a "node in the network" at the level of analysis
  where we are discussing the core mixnet protocol in this here document.

* ``Katzenpost`` - A project to design many improved decryption mixnet protocols.
  
  Classes of traffic - We distinguish the following classes of traffic:

  * SURB Replies (also sometimes referred to as ACKs)
  * Forward messages

* ``Packet`` - Also known as a Sphinx packet. A nested encrypted packet that,
  is routed through the mixnet and cryptographically transformed at each hop.
  The length of the packet is fixed for every class of traffic. Packet payloads
  encapsulate messages.

* ``Payload`` - The payload, also known as packet payload, is a portion of a Packet containing a message,
  or part of a message, to be delivered anonymously.

* ``Message`` - A variable-length sequence of octets sent anonymously
  through the network. Short messages are sent in a single
  packet; long messages are fragmented across multiple
  packets.

* ``MSL`` - Maximum Segment Lifetime, 120 seconds.

1.2 Conventions Used in This Document
-------------------------------------

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]_.

2. System Overview
==================

The presented system design is based on [LOOPIX]_.
Below, we present the system overview.

The entry mixes are responsible for authenticating clients, accepting
packets from the client, and forwarding them to the mix network, which
then relays packets to the destination service mix.  Our network
design uses a strict topology where forward message traverse the
network from entry mix to service mix. Service mixes can optionally
reply if the forward message contained a Single Use Reply Block (see
[SPHINXSPEC]_).

The PKI system that handles the distribution of various network wide
parameters, and information required for each participant to
participate in the network such as IP address/port combinations that
each node can be reached at, and cryptographic public keys. The
specification for the PKI is beyond the scope of this document and is
instead covered in [KATZMIXPKI]_.

The mix network provides neither reliable nor in-order delivery
semantics. The described mix network is neither a user facing
messaging system nor is it an application. It is intended to be a
low level protocol which can be composed to form more elaborate
mixnet protocols with stronger more useful privacy notions.


2.1 Threat Model
-----------------

Here we cannot present the threat model to the higher level mixnet
protocols. However this low level core mixnet protocol does have
it's own threat model which we attempt to illucidate here.

We assume that the clients only talk to mixnet services. These services
make use of a client provided delivery token known as a SURB (Single Use Reply Block)
to send their replies to the client without knowing the client's entry mix.
This system guarantees third-party anonymity, meaning
that no parties other than client and the service are able to learn
that the client and service are communicating. Note that this is
in contrast with other designs, such as Mixminion, which provide
sender anonymity towards recipients as well as anonymous replies.

Mixnet clients will randomly select an entry node to use and may reconnect if
disconnected for under a duration threshold. The entry mix can determine
the approximate message volume originating from and destined to a
given client. We consider the entry mix follows the protocol
and might be an honest-but-curious adversary.

External local network observers can not determine the number of
Packets traversing their region of the network because of the use
of  decoy traffic sent by the clients. Global observers will
not be able to de-anonymize packet paths if there are enough
packets traversing the mix network. Longer term statistical
disclosure attacks are likely possible in order to link senders
and receivers.

A malicious mix only has the ability to remember which input
packets correspond to the output packets. To discover the
entire path all of the mixes in the path would have to be
malicious. Moreover, the malicious mixes can drop, inject, modify
or delay the packets for more or less time than specified.

2.2 Network Topology
---------------------

The Katzenpost Mix Network uses a layered topology consisting of a
fixed number of layers, each containing a set of mixes. At any
given time each Mix MUST only be assigned to one specific layer.
Each Mix in a given layer N is connected to every other Mix in
the previous and next layer, and or every participating Provider
in the case of the mixes in layer 0 or layer N (first and last layer).
::

          Layer 0          Layer 1        Layer 2        Layer 3           Layer 4
       +-----------+      +-------+      +-------+      +-------+      +-------------+
   +-> | entry mix | -+-> |  Mix  | -+-> |  Mix  | -+-> |  Mix  | -+-> | service mix |
   |   +-----------+  |   +-------+  |   +-------+  |   +-------+  |   +-------------+
   |                  |              |              |              |
   |   +-----------+  |   +-------+  |   +-------+  |   +-------+  |   +-------------+
   +-> | entry mix | -+-> |  Mix  | -+-> |  Mix  | -+-> |  Mix  | -+-> | service mix |
   |   +-----------+  |   +-------+  |   +-------+  |   +-------+  |   +-------------+
   |                  |              |              |              |
   |                  |   +-------+  |   +-------+  |   +-------+  |   +-------------+
   |                  +-> |  Mix  | -+-> |  Mix  | -+-> |  Mix  | -+-> | service mix |
   |                      +-------+      +-------+      +-------+  |   +-------------+
   |                                                               |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------+

         Note: Multiple distinct connections are collapsed in the
         figure for sake of brevity/clarity.

The network topology MUST also maximize the number of security
domains traversed by the packets. This can be achieved by not
allowing mixes from the same security domain to be in different layers.

Requirements for the topology:

* Should allow for non-uniform throughput
  of each mix (Get bandwidth weights from the PKI).
* Should maximize distribution among security domains,
  in this case the mix descriptor specified family field
  would indicate the security domain or entity operating the mix.
* Other legal jurisdictional region awareness for increasing
  the cost of compulsion attacks.

3. Packet Format Overview
=========================

For the packet format of the transported messages we use the Sphinx
cryptographic packet format. The detailed description of the
packet format, construction, processing and security/anonymity
considerations see [SPHINXSPEC]_, "The Sphinx Mix Network
Cryptographic Packet Format Specification".

As the Sphinx packet format is generic, the Katzenpost Mix Network
must provide a concrete instantiation of the format, as well as
additional Sphinx per-hop routing information commands.

3.1 Sphinx Cryptographic Primitives
-----------------------------------

For the current version of the Katzenpost Mix Network, let the
following cryptographic primitives be used as described in the
Sphinx specification.

* ``H(M)`` - As the output of this primitive is only used locally to
  a Mix, any suitable primitive may be used.

* ``MAC(K, M)`` - HMAC-SHA256 [RFC6234]_, M_KEY_LENGTH of 32 bytes
  (256 bits), and MAC_LENGTH of 32 bytes (256 bits).

* ``KDF(SALT, IKM)`` - HKDF-SHA256, HKDF-Expand only, with SALT used
  as the info parameter.

* ``S(K, IV)``  - CTR-AES256 [SP80038A]_, S_KEY_LENGTH of 32 bytes
  (256 bits), and S_IV_LENGTH of 12 bytes (96 bits),
  using a 32 bit counter.

* ``SPRP_Encrypt(K, M)/SPRP_Decrypt(K, M)`` - AEZv5 [AEZV5]_,
  SPRP_KEY_LENGTH of 48 bytes (384 bits). As there is a
  disconnect between AEZv5 as specified and the Sphinx
  usage, let the following be the AEZv5 parameters:

  * nonce - 16 bytes, reusing the per-hop Sphinx header IV.
  * additional_data - Unused.
  * tau - 0 bytes.

* ``EXP(X, Y)`` - X25519 [RFC7748]_ scalar multiply, GROUP_ELEMENT_LENGTH
  of 32 bytes (256 bits), G is the X25519 base point.

3.2 Sphinx Packet Parameters
----------------------------

The following parameters are used as for the Katzenpost Mix Network
instantiation of the Sphinx Packet Format:

* ``AD_SIZE``            - 2 bytes.

* ``SECURITY_PARAMETER`` - 32 bytes. (except for our SPRP which we plan to upgrade)

* ``PER_HOP_RI_SIZE``    - (XXX/ya: Addition is hard, let's go shopping.)

* ``NODE_ID_SIZE``       - 32 bytes, the size of the Ed25519 public key,
  used as Node identifiers.

* ``RECIPIENT_ID_SIZE``  - 64 bytes, the maximum size of local-part
  component in an e-mail address.

* ``SURB_ID_SIZE``       - Single Use Reply Block ID size, 16 bytes.

* ``MAX_HOPS``           - 5, the ingress provider, a set of three mixes,
  and the egress provider.

* ``PAYLOAD_SIZE``       - (XXX/ya: Subtraction is hard, let's go shopping.)

* ``KDF_INFO``           - The byte string 'Katzenpost-kdf-v0-hkdf-sha256'.

The Sphinx Packet Header ``additional_data`` field is specified as follows::

      struct {
          uint8_t version;  /* 0x00 */
          uint8_t reserved; /* 0x00 */
      } KatzenpostAdditionalData;
      
.. note::

     Double check to ensure that this causes the rest of the packet
     header to be 4 byte aligned, when wrapped in the wire protocol command
     and framing. This might need to have 3 bytes reserved instead.

All nodes MUST reject Sphinx Packets that have ``additional_data`` that
is not as specified in the header.

.. note::

   Design decision.

   * We can eliminate a trial decryption step per packet around the
     epoch transitions by having a command that rewrites the AD on
     a per-hop basis and including an epoch identifier.

     I am uncertain as to if the additional complexity is worth it
     for a situation that can happen for a few minutes out of every epoch.

3.3 Sphinx Per-hop Routing Information Extensions
-------------------------------------------------

The following extensions are added to the Sphinx Per-Hop Routing
Information commands.

Let the following additional routing commands be defined in the
extension RoutingCommandType range (0x80 - 0xff)::

      enum {
          mix_delay(0x80),
      } KatzenpostCommandType;

The mix_delay command structure is as follows::

      struct {
          uint32_t delay_ms;
      } NodeDelayCommand;

4. Mix Node Operation
=====================

All Mixes behave in the following manner:

* Accept incoming connections from peers, and open persistent
  connections to peers as needed (:ref:`Section 4.1 <4.1>`).

* Periodically interact with the PKI to publish Identity and
  Sphinx packet public keys, and to obtain information about
  the peers it should be communicating with, along with
  periodically rotating the Sphinx packet keys for forward
  secrecy (:ref:`Section 4.2 <4.2>`).

* Process inbound Sphinx Packets, delay them for the specified time
  and forward them to the appropriate Mix and or Provider (:ref:`Section 4.3 <4.3>`).

All Nodes are identified by their link protocol signing key, for
the purpose of the Sphinx packet source routing hop identifier.

All Nodes participating in the Mix Network MUST share a common
view of time, via NTP or similar time synchronization mechanism.

.. _4.1:

4.1 Link Layer Connection Management
------------------------------------

All communication to and from participants in the Katzenpost Mix
Network is done via the Katzenpost Mix Network Wire Protocol [KATZMIXWIRE]_.

Nodes are responsible for establishing the connection to the next
hop, for example, a mix in layer 0 will accept inbound connections
from all Providers listed in the PKI, and will proactively establish
connections to each mix in layer 1.

Nodes MAY accept inbound connections from unknown Nodes, but MUST
not relay any traffic until they became known via listing in the
PKI document, and MUST terminate the connection immediately if
authentication fails for any other reason.

Nodes MUST impose an exponential backoff when reconnecting if a
link layer connection gets terminated, and the minimum retry
interval MUST be no shorter than 5 seconds.

Nodes MAY rate limit inbound connections as required to keep load
and or resource use at a manageable level, but MUST be prepared to
handle at least one persistent long lived connection per
potentially eligible peer at all times.

.. _4.2:

4.2 Sphinx Mix and Provider Key Rotation
----------------------------------------

Each Node MUST rotate the key pair used for Sphinx packet processing
periodically for forward secrecy reasons and to keep the list of seen
packet tags short. The Katzenpost Mix Network uses a fixed interval
(``epoch``), so that key rotations happen simultaneously throughout
the network, at predictable times.

Let each epoch be exactly ``10800 seconds (3 hours)`` in duration, and
the 0th Epoch begin at ``2017-06-01 00:00 UTC``. For more details see
our "Katzenpost Mix Network Public Key Infrastructure Specification"
document. [KATZMIXPKI]_

.. _4.3:

4.3 Sphinx Packet Processing
----------------------------

The detailed processing of the Sphinx packet is described in the
Sphinx specification: "The Sphinx Mix Network Cryptographic Packet
Format Specification”. Below, we present an overview of the steps
which the node is performing upon receiving the packet:

1. Records the time of reception.

2. Perform a ``Sphinx_Unwrap`` operation to authenticate and
   decrypt a packet, discarding it immediately if the operation
   fails.

3. Apply replay detection to the packet, discarding replayed
   packets immediately.

4. Act on the routing commands.

   All packets processed by Mixes MUST contain the following
   commands.

   * ``NextNodeHopCommand``, specifying the next Mix or Provider
     that the packet will be forwarded to.

   * ``NodeDelayCommand``, specifying the delay in milliseconds to
     be applied to the packet, prior to forwarding it to the
     Node specified by the NextNodeHopCommand, as measured from
     the time of reception.

     Mixes MUST discard packets that have any commands other
     than a ``NextNodeHopCommand`` or a ``NodeDelayCommand``. Note that
     this does not apply to Providers or Clients, which have
     additional commands related to recipient and :abbr:`SURB (Single Use Reply Block)` processing.

Nodes MUST continue to accept the previous epoch's key for up
to 1MSL past the epoch transition, to tolerate latency and clock
skew, and MUST start accepting the next epoch's key 1*MSL prior
to the epoch transition where it becomes the current active key.

Upon the final expiration of a key (1MSL past the epoch
transition), Nodes MUST securely destroy the private component
of the expired Sphinx packet processing key along with the backing
store used to maintain replay information associated with the
expired key.

Nodes MAY discard packets at any time, for example to keep
congestion and or load at a manageable level, however assuming
the ``Sphinx_Unwrap`` operation was successful, the packet MUST be
fed into the replay detection mechanism.

Nodes MUST ensure that the time a packet is forwarded to the next Node
is around the time of reception plus the delay specified in ``NodeDelayCommand``.
Since exact millisecond processing is unpractical, implementations MAY tolerate
a small window around that time for packets to be forwarded.
That tolerance window SHOULD be kept minimal.

Nodes MUST discard packets that have been delayed
for significantly more time than specified by the ``NodeDelayCommand``.

5. Anonymity Considerations
===========================

5.1 Topology
------------

Layered topology is used because it offers the best level of
anonymity and ease of analysis, while being flexible enough to
scale up traffic. Whereas most mixnet papers discuss their security
properties in the context of a cascade topology, which does not
scale well, or a free-route network, which quickly becomes
intractable to analyze when the network grows, while providing
slightly worse anonymity than a layered topology. [MIXTOPO10]_

Important considerations when assigning mixes to layers, in order
of decreasing importance, are:

1. Security: do not allow mixes from one security domain to be
   in different layers to maximise the number of security
   domains traversed by a packet

2. Performance: arrange mixes in layers to maximise the capacity
   of the layer with the lowest capacity (the bottleneck layer)

3. Security: arrange mixes in layers to maximise the number of
   jurisdictions traversed by a packet (this is harder to do
   really well than it seems, requires understanding of legal
   agreements such as MLATs).

5.2 Mixing strategy
-------------------

As a mixing technique the Poisson mix strategy [LOOPIX]_
[KESDOGAN98]_ is used, which REQUIRES that a packet at each hop in
the route is delayed by some amount of time, randomly selected by
the sender from an exponential distribution. This strategy allows
to prevent the timing correlation of the incoming and outgoing
traffic from each node. Additionally, the parameters of the
distribution used for generating the delay can be tuned up and down
depending on the amount of traffic in the network and the application
for which the system is deployed.

6. Security Considerations
==========================

The source of all authority in the mixnet system comes from the
Directory Authority system which is also known as the mixnet PKI.
This system gives the mixes and clients a consistent view of the
network while allowing human intervention when needed. All public
mix key material and network connection information is distributed
by this Directory Authority system.
