**Abstract**

In the context of continuous time mixing stategies such
as the memoryless mix used by Katzenpost, n-1 attacks may use strategic
packetloss. Nodes can also fail for benign reasons.
Determining whether or not it's an n-1 attack is outside the scope
of this work.

This document describes how we will communicate statistics from mix nodes
to mix network directory authorities which tells them about the packetloss they are
observing.

## 1. Design Overview

Nodes (mixes, gateways, and providers) need upload packet-loss
statistics to the directory authorities, so that authorities can
label malfunctioning nodes as such in the consensus in the next epoch.

Nodes currently sign and upload a Descriptor in each epoch.

In the future, they would instead upload a "UploadDescStats" containing:
    * Descriptor
    * Stats
    * Signature

Stats contains:
    * a map from pairs-of-mixes to the ratio of count-of-loops-sent vs count-of-loops-received

### 1.3 Terminology

- `wire protocol` - refers to our PQ Noise based protocol which currently uses TCP but in the
near future will optionally use QUIC. This protocol has messages known as wire protocol `commands`, which are
used for various mixnet functions such as sending or retrieving a message, dirauth voting etc.
For more information, please see our design doc: [wire protocol specification](https://github.com/katzenpost/katzenpost/blob/main/docs/specs/wire-protocol.md)

- `Providers` - refers to a set of node on the edge of the network which have two roles,
handle incoming client connections and run mixnet services. Soon we should get rid of `Providers`
and replace it with two different sets, `gateway nodes` and `service nodes`.

- `Epoch` - The Katzenpost epoch is currently set to a 20 minute duration. Each new epoch
there is a new PKI document published containing public key material that will only 
be valid for that epoch.



## 2. Tracking Packet Loss and Detecting Faulty Mixes

Katzenpost lets different elements in the network track whether other
elements are functioning correctly.  A node A will do this by sending
packets in randomly generated loops through the network, and tracking
whether the loop comes back or not. When it comes back, it will mark
that as evidence, that the nodes on the path of that loop are
functioning correctly.

Experimental setup, node A:

* Data: each network node `A` collects a record of emitted test loops
  in a certain epoch, their paths and whether they returned or
  not. Importantly, each loop is the same length and includes l steps.
* A segment is defined as a possible connection from a device in the
  network to another, for example from a node in the layer `k` to a
  node in the layer `k+1`. Each loop is a sequence of such segments.
* Each node `A` will create 3 hashmaps, `sent_loops_A`,
  `completed_loops_A` and `ratios_A`. Each of these will use
  a pair of concatenated mixnode ID's as the key. The ordering of
  the ID's will be from lesser topology layer to greater, e.g.
  the two-tuple (n, n+1) which is represented here as a 64 byte array:
```
var sent_loops_A map[[64]byte]int
var completed_loops_A map[[64]byte]int
var ratios_A map[[64]byte]float64
```
* Every time the node A sends out a test loop, for each segment in the
  loop path, it will increment the value in `sent_loops_A`.
* When a test loop returns, for each step in the loop path, it will
  increment the value in `completed_loops_A`.
* Generate a new map entry in `ratios_A` for each mix-node-pair `p`, if
  `sent_loops_A[p]==0` set `ratios_A[p]=1`. Else `ratios_A[p] =
  completed_loops_A[p]/sent_loops_A[p]`
* Plot the resulting distribution, and calculate the standard
  deviation to detect anomalies. Have the node report significant
  anomalies after a sufficient time period as to not leak information
  on the route of individual loops.
* Anomalies may have to be discarded if the corresponding
  `sent_loops_A[p]` is small.

You would expect the distribution of values in `completed_loops` to
approximate a binomial distribution. In an absence of faulty nodes,
`ratios` should be 1, and when there are some faulty nodes values at
faulty nodes should approach 0 (if the node doesnâ€™t work at all), and
be binomially distributed at nodes that can share a loop with faulty
nodes.

Therefore each mix node generates a statistics report to upload
to the dirauth nodes, of the struct type:

```
type LoopStats struct {
    Epoch           uint64
    MixIdentityHash *[32]byte
    Ratios          map[[64]byte]float64
}
```

The report is subsequently uploaded to the directory authorities,
which combine the reports of individual nodes into a health status of
the network and arrive at a consensus decision about the topology of
the network.



## 3. Uploading Stats to Dirauths

Stats reports are uploaded along with the mix descriptor every Epoch.
A cryptographic signature covers both of these fields:

```
type UploadDescStats struct {
         Descriptor []byte
         StatsReport []byte
         Signature []byte
 }
```


Statistics reports collected during the XXX period of time, that is,
the time between descriptor N+1 upload and descriptor N+2 upload, are
what will affect the topology choices in epoch N+2 if the dirauths
collectively decide to act on the very latest statistics reports in
order to determine for example if a mix node should be removed from
the network:


```

| ---------------- epoch N ---------------- | ---------------- epoch N+1 ---------------- | ---------------- epoch N+2 ---------------- |
| ----------- UD_N+1 ---------------------- | ------------ UD N+2 ----------------------- | ----------- UD N+3 ------------------------ |
         | ------------------ XXX ---------------- |
```
