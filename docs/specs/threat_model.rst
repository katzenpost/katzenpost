Overview of Mix Network Threat Model
====================================

Katzenpost is a decryption mixnet with no verification.
In this context we can talk about individual mix nodes as
a specialized kind of cryptographic router that has two
properties other than routing messages to their destination:

1. bitwise unlinkability
2. latency

Bitwise unlinkability means that the adversary would not be able
to link an output message with an input message based on the bits in the message.
Likewise adding latency also helps prevent a network observer from
correlating input messages with output messages on a mix node.

When mixes are composed in a network we get the Anytrust property
which means that if a path (aka route) consists of at least one honest
mix then there is still uncertainty for a passive network observer for
the correlation between sent and received messages. There are many caveats
here, see attacks below.

There is a hierarchy of security notions that are used by
cryptographers to compare cryptographic primitives. Likewise, a
hierarchy of privacy notions help us compare anonymous communication
protocols. See [NOTIONS]_ for an in depth discussion and algebraic
analsysis of privacy notions for anonymous communication protocols.

At the time of writing it is my understanding that the mixnet protocols
we want to see in the world would have these privacy notions:

1. Sender Unobservability
2. Receiver Unobservability
3. Sender Receiver Unlinkability

The unobservability notions are a result of using decoy traffic whose use
has limitations expressed in the anonymity trilemma. 
   
Our threat model will consider the following eight categories of attacks:

1. n-1 attacks
2. epistemic attacks
3. compulsion attacks
4. tagging attacks
5. statistical disclosure attacks
6. denial of service attacks
7. timing attacks
8. cryptographic attacks (including considerations regarding
   cryptographic attacks by a sufficiently powerful quantum
   computational adversary)

As of the time of this writing, ALL mixnet attacks that we know about fit
into one or more of the above categories or composite attacks, a
combination of several of the above attacks.


1. statistical disclosure attacks
=================================

**Adversary capability:** In general for this particular attack
category we assume that the adversary is a global passive
adversary. However all of these attacks are actually possible with
only a view of the perimeter of the mix network.

**Adversary strategy:** The adversary's goal is to capture as much of
the social graph as they can by collecting sets of possible recipients
of each sender and likewise sets of possible senders for each
recipient.

**Primary Mitigation tactic:**

The best defense against intersection attacks is to use end to end
decoy traffic which is sent and received by clients.

Imagine there is a mixnet with 10 Providers and only Alice and Bob are
currently connected and sending messages. Alice does not send any
decoy traffic. Mixes send loop decoys to themselves. Alice only sends
messages to a Provider which Bob can retrieve messages from.

In this example we can say two things for certain:

1. mix decoy loops will be uniformly distributed over all 10 Providers
2. Alice's sent messages will go to 1 of 10 Providers

Therefore, without the use of end to end decoy traffic, a global
adversary would be able to keep track of their observations of the
network perimeter and learn statistical information about the social
graph. In this example the uniform distribution of messages is perturbed
by Alice's behavior on the network.

**Mitigation tactic #1**

In the context of Katzenpost/Loopix these classical style set
intersection attacks don't work at full granularity because
destination messages are queued on edge nodes (known as Providers)
along with many other received messages to and from other users of the
mix network.

**Mitigation tactic #2**

Many of our future protocols will scatter message segments across an
ever changing set of Providers. This seems likely to increase uncertainty
for adversaries.

**Mitigation tactic #3**

Clients will send decoy traffic such that the rate of all messages
arriving on all of the Providers will be uniformly distributed even
when the client is sending legit messages to a subset of Providers.

**Mitigation tactic #4**

Providers will modulate their decoy traffic send rate to be
inversely proportional to the sum of all the rates of incoming
messages from all clients directly connected to that Provider. In
other words, when clients send zero messages the Provider sends a
constant rate of decoy traffic. The Provider reduces it's decoy
send rate when clients increase their send rate such that the total
rate of messages coming out of the Provider remains the same if
measured over a large enough period of time.

**Conclusion**

The sucess of a statistical disclosure attacks often has a lot to do with
the advesary's ability to predict user behavior. Likewise if user behavior
is very repetative and predictable then that might increase the probability
that a statistical disclosure attack would work. These attacks could in theory
take days/weeks or even months to perform depending on how much statistical
information is leaked.
   
Statistical disclosure attacks such as short term timing correlation
that the Tor network is known to be trivially vulnerable against do
not in general apply to mix networks due to the added latency. However
as latency is decreased we find ourselves pondering the Anonymity
Trilemma [ANONTRILEMMA]_ which clearly states that Strong Anonymity is in opposition
to low latency unless we send lots of decoy traffic. We need a formal
methodogy for tuning the mixnet AND making the numerical calculations
of the various tradeoffs that are the result of the mixnet tuning.

2. epistemic attacks
====================

An epistemic attack refers to an attack where the adversary uses their knowledge of
a mixnet client's knowledge of the network to their advantage. For example if Alice
only learns of a subset of the network nodes then the adversary who knows this about
Alice (or perhaps caused Alice to have partial knowledge) will be able to at least
state some obvious conclusions such as: "messages sent along these routes are more
likely to have come from Alice than any other client".

In general we mitigate this attack category by designing our key management and distribution
(aka the dirauth system aka PKI) such that it shares the same information with all the clients.


3. compulsion attacks
=====================

**Adversary capability:** The adversary uses forceful means to
procure the information they are after: violence, legal system,
remotely compromising mix nodes using a zero day from the black market etc.

**Conclusion**

Reply Blocks (SURBs), forward and reply Sphinx packets [SPHINX09]_ are all
vulnerable to the compulsion threat, if they are captured by an
adversary. The adversary can request iterative decryptions or keys
from a series of honest mixes in order to perform a deanonymizing
trace of the destination.

While a general solution to this class of attacks is beyond the
scope of this document, applications that seek to mitigate or
resist compulsion threats could implement the defenses proposed
in [COMPULS05]_ via a series of routing command extensions.


4. tagging attacks
==================

There are many different types of tagging attacks.
This is the only one I could think of that applies to
Katzenpost, in an albeit contrived scenario.

**Adversary capability**

If the adversary is allowed to view the final payload decryption and
can mutate the packet during it's transit then a 1 bit tagging attack
is possible.

**Adversary strategy:**

Flipping a bit during transit would cause lots of bits
to be flipped in each subsequent decryption set and thus the final
payload integrity tag would be destroyed. So for the adversary,
either the interity tag is intact or it is destroyed; this attack
leaks 1 bit of information to the advesary.

**Conclusion**

This is Sphinx payload tagging attack is a result of the Sphinx
design. However it's a very contrived example and we have trouble
imagining it would apply in the real world.


Sphinx Payload Encryption Considerations
----------------------------------------

The payload encryption's use of a fragile (non-malleable) SPRP is
deliberate and implementations SHOULD NOT substitute it with a
primitive that does not provide such a property (such as a stream
cipher based PRF). In particular there is a class of correlation
attacks (tagging attacks) targeting anonymity systems that involve
modification to the ciphertext that are mitigated if alterations
to the ciphertext result in unpredictable corruption of the
plaintext (avalanche effect).

Additionally, as the PAYLOAD_TAG_LENGTH based tag-then-encrypt
payload integrity authentication mechanism is predicated on the
use of a non-malleable SPRP, implementations that substitute a
different primitive MUST authenticate the payload using a
different mechanism.

Alternatively, extending the MAC contained in the Sphinx Packet
Header to cover the Sphinx Packet Payload will both defend against
tagging attacks and authenticate payload integrity. However, such an
extension does not work with the SURB construct presented in this
specification, unless the SURB is only used to transmit payload
that is known to the creator of the SURB.

5. denial of service attacks
============================

We don't have much defense against DOS attacks.
Currently the Provider has a per client rate limiter that can be tuned by
the dirauth system.

6. timing attacks
=================

We probably have potential for many many timing attacks.
Can we enumerate some of the more obvious and powerful timing attacks here?

7. n-1 Attacks
==============

**Adversary capability:** Adversary is active and can send messages into the mix network
AND the adversary can drop or delay messages sent to the mix network. Therefore the adversary
has compromised the upstream routers for each of the perimeter mix nodes.

**Adversary strategy:** There are many variations of n-1 attacks and the one that works on
Poisson mix strategy is this:

The adversary must delay or drop input messages to a given mix until
they are reasonably certain the mix is empty before allowing the
target message to enter and then exit the mix. The result of this
attack is that the adversary learns where the target message is being
sent.

**Primary Mitigation tactic:**
Our theoretical defense is:

Each mix node uses a loop decoy heartbeat protocol to detect when an adversary is delaying
or dropping input messages; that is, if the mix node doesn't receive it's own heartbeat loop
message then it has detected this attack. A real world implementation would probably add
some additional heuristics for example, the n-1 attack is detected when 3 heartbeats in a
row were not received.

**Our current status is:**

* Mix loop decoy traffic is only implemented on interior mixes but it should also
  be implemented on Provders.
* The status of the decoy replies is ignored. Instead it should do bookkeeping and
  stop routing messages for some duration if certain heuristics are matched which
  include a threshold number of heartbeat messages not being recently received.

8. cryptographic attacks
========================

This category should include not only merely breaking cryptographic primitives
but also breaking the cryptographic protocols on a higher level of abstraction.
One great example of this is the following attack on SURB usage described below.

SURB Usage Considerations for Volunteer Operated Mix Networks
-------------------------------------------------------------

Given a hypothetical scenario where Alice and Bob both wish to keep
their location on the mix network hidden from the other, and Alice
has somehow received a SURB from Bob, Alice MUST not utilize the
SURB directly because in the volunteer operated mix network the
first hop specified by the SURB could be operated by Bob for the
purpose of deanonymizing Alice.

This problem could be solved via the incorporation of a "cross-over
point" such as that described in [MIXMINION]_, for example by
having Alice delegating the transmission of a SURB Reply to a
randomly selected crossover point in the mix network, so that
if the first hop in the SURB's return path is a malicious mix,
the only information gained is the identity of the cross-over
point.
