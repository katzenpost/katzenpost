.. rubric:: Abstract

Here I present a modification of the Sphinx cryptographic packet
format that uses a KEM instead of a NIKE whilest preserving the
properties of bitwise unlinkability, constant packet size and
route length hiding.

1. Introduction
===============

We'll express our KEM Sphinx header in pseudo code. The Sphinx body
will be exactly the same as [SPHINXSPEC]_. Our basic KEM API
has three functions:

* PRIV_KEY, PUB_KEY = GEN_KEYPAIR(RNG)

* ct, ss = ENCAP(PUB_KEY) - Encapsulate generates a shared
  secret, ss, for the public key and encapsulates it into a ciphertext.

* ss = DECAP(PRIV_KEY, ct) - Decapsulate computes the shared key, ss,
  encapsulated in the ciphertext, ct, for the private key.

Therefore we must embed these KEM ciphertexts in the KEMSphinx header,
one KEM ciphertext per mix hop.

2. Post Quantum Hybrid KEM
==========================

Special care must be taken in order correctly compose a hybrid post
quantum KEM that is IND-CCA2 robust.

The hybrid post quantum KEMs found in Cloudflare's circl library are
suitable to be used with Noise or TLS but not with KEM Sphinx because
they are not IND-CCA2 robust. Noise and TLS achieve IND-CCA2 security
by mixing in the public keys and ciphertexts into the hash object and
therefore do not require an IND-CCA2 KEM.

Firstly, our post quantum KEM is IND-CCA2 however we must specifically take care
to make our NIKE to KEM adapter have semantic security. Secondly, we must make a
security preserving KEM combiner.

2.1 NIKE to KEM adapter
-----------------------

We easily achieve our IND-CCA2 security by means of hashing
together the DH shared secret along with both of the public keys:

```
func ENCAPSULATE(their_pubkey publickey) ([]byte, []byte) {
        my_privkey, my_pubkey = GEN_KEYPAIR(RNG)
        ss = DH(my_privkey, their_pubkey)
        ss2 = H(ss || their_pubkey || my_pubkey)
	return my_pubkey, ss2
}

func DECAPSULATE(my_privkey, their_pubkey) []byte {
        s = DH(my_privkey, their_pubkey)
	shared_key = H(ss || my_pubkey || their_pubkey)
	return shared_key
}
```


2.2 KEM Combiner
----------------

The KEM Combiners paper [KEMCOMB]_ makes the observation that if a KEM combiner
is not security preserving then the resulting hybrid KEM will not have
IND-CCA2 security if one of the composing KEMs does not have IND-CCA2
security. Likewise the paper points out that when using a security
preserving KEM combiner, if only one of the composing KEMs has
IND-CCA2 security then the resulting hybrid KEM will have IND-CCA2
security.

Our KEM combiner uses the split PRF design from the paper when combining
two KEM shared secrets together we use a hash function to also mix
in the values of both KEM ciphertexts. In this pseudo code
example we are hashing together the two shared secrets
from the two underlying KEMs, ss1 and ss2. Additionally
the two ciphertexts from the underlying KEMs, cct1 and cct2,
are also hashed together:

```
// H is a hash function

func splitPRF(ss1, ss2, cct1, cct2 []byte) []byte {
        return H(ss1 || ss2 || cct1 || cct2)
}
```


3. KEMSphinx Header Design
==========================

NIKE Sphinx header elements:

1. version number (MACed but not encrypted)
2. group element
3. encrypted per routing commands
4. MAC for this hop (authenticates header fields 1 thru 4)

KEM Sphinx header elements:

1. version number (MACed but not encrypted)
2. one KEM ciphertext for use with the next hop
3. encrypted per routing commands AND KEM ciphtertexts, one for each additional hop
4. MAC for this hop (authenticates header fields 1 thru 4)

We can say that KEMSphinx differs from NIKE Sphinx by replacing the
header's group element (e.g. an X25519 public key) field with the KEM ciphertext.
Subsequent KEM ciphertexts for each hop are stored inside the Sphinx header
"routing information" section.

First we must have a data type to express a mix hop, and we can use
lists of these hops to express a route:

   .. code::

      type PathHop struct {
              public_key kem.PublicKey
	      routing_commands Commands
      }


Here's how we construct a KEMSphinx packet header where `path`
is a list of PathHop, and indicates the route through the network:


1. Derive the KEM ciphertexts for each hop.

   .. code::
      route_keys = []
      route_kems = []
      for i := 0; i < num_hops; i++ {
              kem_ct, ss := ENCAP(path[i].public_key)
	      route_kems += kem_ct
	      route_keys += ss
      }
      
2. Derive the routing_information keystream and encrypted
   padding for each hop.

   Same as in [SPHINXSPEC]_ except for the fact that each
   routing info slot is now increased by the size of the KEM ciphertext.

3. Create the routing_information block.

Here we modify the Sphinx implementation to pack the next KEM
ciphertext into each routing information block. Each of these
blocks is decrypted for each mix mix hop which will decrypt
the KEM ciphertext for the next hop in the route.

4. Assemble the completed Sphinx Packet Header and Sphinx Packet
   Payload SPRP key vector. Same as in [SPHINXSPEC]_ except the
   `kem_element` field is set to the first KEM ciphertext, `route_kems[0]`:

    .. code::

       var sphinx_header SphinxHeader
       sphinx_header.additional_data = version
       sphinx_header.kem_element = route_kems[0]
       sphinx_header.routing_info = routing_info
       sphinx_header.mac = mac


2. KEMSphinx Unwrap Operation
=============================

Most of the design here will be exactly the same as in [SPHINXSPEC]_.
However there are a few notable differences:

1. The shared secret is derived from the KEM ciphertext instead of a DH.
2. Next hop's KEM ciphertext stored in the encrypted routing information.


3. Acknowledgments
==================

I would like to thank Peter Schwabe for the original idea of simply
replacing the Sphinx NIKE with a KEM and for answering all my questions.

I'd also like to thank Bas Westerbaan for answering questions.
