    <title xml:id="components.title">Using &program_name; from behind a NAT device</title>
    <para>&program_name; can be used from behind NAT devices. Both mix and dirauth nodes.</para>
    <para>Some networking scenearios do not require any manual port forwarding, such as operating an ec2 node on AWS,
    the node listens on an internal IP address yet can receive connections that get routed to a public IP address.
    There is a NAT device involved here but it's default policy is to route all trafic to the node.
    Whereas in a home router NAT device, it's default policy is to block inbound connections. For this later
    scenario, the operator must setup port forwarding to the appropriate internal IP address and port number.
    </para>
    <para>The dirauth is a cooperative crash fault tolerant voting system composed of multiple dirauth nodes.
    However, each of these dirauth nodes must have knowledge of the other dirauth node's network connection information
    and public cryptographic key material. It's often convenient enough for dirauth operators to use a private git repo to coordinate
    changes to the dirauth configurations and public key materials. Therefore, dirauth operators wishing to
    operate a node behind a NAT device can configure their node to listen on a RFC1918 address such as 192.168.1.22
    and yet tell the other dirauth node operators that their publicly routable address is some other IP address or perhaps a Tor Onion address.
	We refer you to the Tor onion setup docs for more information: https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/setup/

    <para/>
    <para>Gateway nodes MUST use the BindAddresses option. This is only supported by the Gateway nodes. The mix nodes and service nodes
    are not permitted to use the BindAddresses options because the alternate transports that implies are not supported between mix nodes.</para>

    <para>DIAGRAM: ROUTER, IPs, etc.</para>
    <para>mix node, device NAT device/router; Nat dev has an Internet route. Internall, mix node
        binds to an internal addrexs (show configuration). This is the same for Tor, but with Onion
        addess rahter that a static IP  (see Tor and link)</para>
    <para>NATPMP STUN TURNâ€“ these are Nat PENETRATION PROTOCLDS... NOT SUPPORTED</para>
    <para>Two diagrams...Onion and IPv4/IPv6</para>
    <para>This confguration only allows for the Gateway nodes (which are also mix nodes).</para>
    <para>We need a to show an excerpt from a torrc to show where the onion listening port is
        confuigred.</para>
