.. rubric:: Abstract

This is intended to be used as a store-and-forward medium for
publish-subscribe types of applications, such as mailboxes for chat or
email and email-like systems, and as a general-purpose inter-process
communication mechanism for any message-oriented application where a
strict ordering of messages is not required.

1. Introduction
===============

We present a system providing durable storage of semi-ordered data for
both long-term and ephemeral applications, without relying on single
points of failure, using a CRDT construction with cryptographic
capabilities inspired by [TAHOELAFS]_ to define who can read, write,
replicate, and delete the data, as well as who can grant and revoke
the other capabilities.

In particular:

- writers should be able to tell how many replicas have received their write
- if a replica is compromised/malicious, it should only be able to DoS
  subsequent operations that it is asked to perform (which should be easily
  detectable) and able to perform a limited amount of traffic analysis.

1.1 Terminology
----------------

* ``CRDT`` - Conflict-free replicated data type is a data structure
  which can be replicated across multiple computers in a network,
  where the replicas can be updated independently and concurrently
  without coordination between the replicas, and where it is always
  mathematically possible to resolve inconsistencies which might
  result.

* ``node`` - A node is an operator which provides services, and has a
  stable address where it can receive requests. In addition to the
  various keypairs it has for performing its services, it has a single
  long-term identity keypair.

* ``operator`` - An operator is an agent that controls one or more
  keypairs and is able to initiate requests.

* ``Requests`` - Requests are sent to nodes by initiators
  (operators). Requests may include a response handle, to which one or
  more responses can be sent to the initiator. Initiators do not need
  a long-term identity; they can potentially be anonymous.

* ``PK`` - The public part of a keypair.

* ``SK`` - The secret part of a keypair.

* ``SDS`` - Signed Discrete Spool. Described below in section 4.

* ``AOSDS`` - Append-only Signed Discrete Spool is described in section 4.1.

* ``AOROSC`` - Add-Once-Remove-Once Set Collection is described in section 5.

* ``PSDS`` - Permissioned Signed Discrete Spool is described in Section 6.

* ``EPSDS`` - Encrypted Permissioned Signed Discrete Spool is described
  in section 7.

* ``DAS`` - Durable Authenticated Spool is described in section 8.

* ``pool`` - Note: pools aren't used in the spec below yet, you can
  ignore them for now.  A pool is a content-addressable unordered
  set. That is, a key-value store where the key is the hash of the
  value.

2. System Overview
==================

XXX Write me.

2.1 Ingredients
---------------

This specification does not (yet) define which primitives should be used. These
are the types of primitives required by what has been specified so far:

- A serialization format. (So far, we only need to be able to serialize tuples
  of bytestrings, but this will probably change.)
- A signature scheme, optionally supporting ring signatures (for multiple
  writers where the replicas cannot tell which writer is writing)
- A hash function.
- An asymmetric encryption scheme.

We are also not defining how to find out about the nodes which provide
services; at this layer we assume that there is some external mechanism by
which users learn about nodes' keys and addresses.

3. Discrete spool
=================

A discrete spool is an ordered list of items. It is an object implementing
these methods:

- append(message) -> index

  Writes a message to the spool.

 - message is a bytestring
 - index is the index of the item that was just written (which is the length of the spool minus 1)

- read(index, limit=1) -> series of messages

   Returns the item at index, and some number of items after it.

 - index is a position in the spool.
 - limit is a maximum number of messages to return, or 0 for all messages

- forget(index)

  Forgets everything older than index.

 - index is a position in the spool.

  The discrete spool interface is not intended to be provided to more than one
  entity, it is a low-level local interface upon which the following interfaces
  may be implemented.

4. Signed discrete spool
========================

* Also known as SDS.

A signed discrete spool is like a discrete spool, but is initialized with a PK
called the "spool key". It can be implemented on top of a discrete spool. A SDS
has these methods:

- append(message, spool_signature) -> index

 Writes a message to the spool. Note that the message written to the
 underlying discrete spool is actually (message, spool_signature).

 - message is a bytestring
 - index is the index of the item that was just written (which is the length
   of the spool minus 1)
 - spool_signature is a signature from the spool SK over
   (message, spool_signature-of-previous-message)

- read(index, limit=1) -> series of (message, spool_signature)

 Returns the item at index, and some number of items after it.

 - index is a position in the spool.
 - limit is a maximum number of messages to return, or 0 for all messages

- forget(index)

  Forgets everything older than index.

 - index is a position in the spool.

Note that writing to an SDS requires knowing its current state. In general, it
is expected that only a single operator would write via this interface, and
that the single operator would have exclusive access to the interface for it
(and the spool key that is required to write to it).

If multiple uncoordinated writers are desired (which would require that each
have a copy of the same single secret key) they will need to be prepared have
their writes fail when other writes have occurred since their previous read.

Possibly a strict mode should exist wherein a second valid spool_signature over
an already-used previous state is considered evidence of key compromise, and
triggers an exceptional state.

The read interface MAY be made available to other parties, which might make
sense for some applicatons. The forget method obviously MUST NOT be made
directly available to others, as it is unauthenticated at this layer.

Note that the SDS is roughly equivalent to Secure Scuttlebutt, but with a
forget method.

4.1 Append-only Signed Discrete Spool
-------------------------------------

* Also known as AOSDS.

An append-only SDS is an SDS without the forget method.

5. Add-Once-Remove-Once Set Collection
======================================

* Also known as AOROSC.

An add-once-remove-once set collection is an AOSDS which defines
membership in various sets. It can be thought of as logically
equivalent to a number of "2P-Set" (two-phase set) CRDTs [WIKICRDT]_.

There are two types of messages which can be written to this spool:

- add(setname, item)
- remove(setname, item)

Items and set names are bytestrings.

Attempting to add an item that has already been removed yields an error; items
can be preemptively removed, however.

In addition to the standard AOSDS interface, it has another method:

- get(setname) -> set of items

This returns the set of items that have been added, minus the set that have
been removed.

Instead of using one AOSDS, a AOROSC could potentially be implemented using an
AOROSC for the tombstones ("remove" messages) and a normal truncatable SDS for
the add messages, but currently it seems like this optimiziation isn't worth
the compexity that it would add.

6. Permissioned Signed Discrete Spool
=====================================

* Also known as PSDS.

A permissioned signed discrete spool consists of an SDS called the data spool,
and an AOROSC called the meta spool. The meta spool describes membership in
sets which define various roles, as well as a special set called "truncatable"
which initially contains one item (the string "yes").

6.1 Roles
---------

- Meta Writer (PKs)
- Meta Reader (PKs)
- Data Writer (PKs)
- Data Reader (PKs)
- Canonical Data Reader (PKs)
- FIXME: define K-of-N schemes here? something with schnorr? later...

The operator of a PSDS reads from and writes to the data and meta spools
through the SDS and AOROSC interfaces, and provides other operators
permissioned access to them via this interface:

- {data,meta}_append(message, write_signature) -> receipt

 Writes a message. Note that the message written to the underlying SDS is
 actually (message, write_signature), which means that the messages in the
 underlying Discrete Spool are ((message, write_signature), spool_signature)

 - message is a bytestring
 - write_signature is a signature over the message from a valid writer key
      (or a ring signature from one, using all others' PKs)
 - receipt is a a 3-tuple of (spool_signature, index, spool_signature-of-previous-message)

  - index is a position in the spool

- {data,meta}_read(index, read_signature, limit=1) -> series of (message, index, write_signature, spool_signature)
  Returns the item at index, and all items after it.

 - index is a position in the spool.
 - read_signature is a signature (or ring signature) from a valid reader key over (index, spool_key)

  - note: the reader signs the spool_key here so that an operator that
          gets removed can't reuse its signtures to read from other replicas
          later.

 - limit is a maximum number of messages to return
 - write_signature is the message writer's signature
 - spool_signature is the operator's signature on the underlying SDS

- forget(tombstone, signature)

Forgets everything in the data spool older than then tombstone specifies.

 - tombstone is a 2-tuple of (replica, prev_spool_signature) refering to a
   previous message (like the index in the read operation)
 - signature is a signature over the tombstone, from a canonical reader

 - FIXME: here we have a layering violation; the PSDS needs to know about
   replicas :(

Note the differences from the SDS interface:

- Readers need to authenticate themselves.

 - FIXME: should they really? should knowing the spool's identity be
   enough to read from it? think POLA; are we relying on operators to do
   more than we need them to (or can verify they are doing correctly) by
   asking them to provide access control for reads?

- writers do not need to know the current state of the spool. (They can't
  be expected to, because they might not be readers.)
- writers receive a receipt which is a cryptographic claim that the
  PSDS operator wrote the message. the receipt contains the previous
  spool_signature, as well, so that the writer can verify this
  signature.
- Readers don't refer to an absolute index, but rather a relative one. The
  "index" in the read operation is NOT the write_signature, but rather the
  spool_signature AND the name of the replica that made it.

 - FIXME: should that exist at this layer? single-replica PSDS seems
   useful, but how to make it fit under the DAS without layering
   violations is not so clear still.

- Truncating the spool requires a signature from a canonical reader. (It is
  expected that there is typically only one canonical reader.)

When a PSDS is created, an initial writer PK for the meta spool must be
provided. That SK can then be used to write messages to the meta spool adding
reader and writer PKs for the data and/or meta spools.

7. Encrypted Permissioned Signed Discrete Spool
===============================================

* Also known as EPSDS.

From the perspective of the spool operator, an EPSDS behaves just like a PSDS.
The only difference is that there is an additional set in the meta spool called
Data Encryption containing one or more encryption PKs. When these keys are
present, users writing to the spool encrypt their messages to all of the
encryption keys before writing them (using a scheme left undefined here for
now). Readers will then of course need one of the encryption SKs to decrypt the
messages they receive from the spool operator.

Note that a malicious spool operator cannot simply insert its own encryption
key and cause writers to write to it, because the metaspool is signed by a Meta
Writer key which the reader already knew.

8. Durable Authenticated Spool
==============================

* Also known as DAS.

A DAS is a semi-ordered spool that is replicated across PSDSes operated by a
number of different nodes. Reads and writes can be performed by sending
requests to any node using cryptographic capabilities containing keys stored in
the PSDSes' meta spools.

The methods available are the same as the PSDS, except for that instead of
"{data,meta}_append" methods there are "{data,meta}_add" methods with this
signature:

- {data,meta}_add(message, write_signature) -> series of receipts from replicas
  Writes a message. Note that the message written to the underlying SDS is
  actually (message, write_signature).

 - message is a bytestring
 - write_signature is a signature over the message from a valid writer key
   (or a ring signature from one, using all others' PKs)

- {data,meta}_read(index, read_signature, limit=1) -> series of (message, index, write_signature, spool_signature)

Returns the item at index, and all items after it.

 - index is NOT a position in the spool here, because there is no longer a
   fixed ordering of messages at this layer. Instead, index is a 2-tuple of
   (spool_key PK, spool_signature).
 - read_signature is a signature (or ring signature) from a valid reader key over (index, spool_key)

  - spool_key is the spool_key of the replica that the reader is performing the read from
  - note: the reader signs the spool_key here so that an operator that
    gets removed can't reuse its signtures to read from other replicas
    later.

 - limit is a maximum number of messages to return
 - write_signature is the message writer's signature
 - spool_signature is the operator's signature on the underlying SDS


8.1 Creation
------------

1. The creator generates a keypair for this DAS called the Root Key.

2. It selects some nodes to act as replicas, and asks each to create a new
   PSDS. The replica nodes are the operators of their respective PSDSes; they
   hold the spool keys. The Root Key is placed in the writer role for the meta
   spools of each.

3. The DAS creator writes replica descriptors for each replica into a new
   "replica" set in each PSDS's meta spool. Each replica descriptor contains
   the replica's PSDS's PK, and one or more addresses where that replica can
   be reached. XXX avoid using the term "that replica".

4. Each replica subscribes to each other replica, using the PSDS
   {data,meta}_read methods. It will subsequently receive any writes to that
   replica. XXX Not a complete sentence. What the does "that replica" refer to?

5. The DAS creator adds Reader and Writer keys to any replica. Those writes
   are subsequently replicated to the others.

8.2 Operation
-------------

- Writers can write to any replica. When the other replicas receive the
  messages via their subscriptions to the replica that was written to, they
  validate the signature to ensure it came from a key that they currently
  consider a valid writer, and add it to their own data spool.

- When a canonical reader calls the forget method, the replica they called
  it on writes their signed tombstone message into the data spool so that
  other replicas will know that they can forget it.

- When a replica receives a read request with an spool_signature from
  another replica, and that spool_signature is not in the set of
  spool_signatures from that replica which this replica has seen
  before, it returns all messages which are not in the local copy of
  the other replica's spool. XXX avoid using the term "that replica".
  this makes no sense. please stop using the singular term
  replica. it's too generic. try labeling them for clarity and
  writing proper english paragraphs with multiple sentences.
