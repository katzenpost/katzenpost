Priority Development tasks (which do not include design work)
=============================================================

Unit tests
----------

The mix server and Directory Authority server should have unit tests
that can be used with a continuous integration system such as Travis.
This should hopefully shed light on some Directory Authority server
bugs and help us fix them as well as prevent regressions.

Priority Design tasks
=====================

Upgrade Link Layer Protocol
---------------------------

Upgrade mixnet link layer to use the Kyber PQ KEM instead of New Hope Simple
because Dr. Peter Schwabe says it's a good idea. It also greatly simplifies
rustification. Before this development task begins the specification document
should reflect the necessary changes:

* https://github.com/katzenpost/docs/blob/master/specs/wire-protocol.rst


Key Agility
-----------

Currently Katzenpost mix servers and Directory Authority servers do not have key agility.
That is to say, there is no way for these servers to change their static identity keys.
The two primary reasons for key agility are recovery from a known key compromise
and as a prerequisite for usage with a hardware security module.

Early unfinished key agility draft specification document:
* https://github.com/katzenpost/docs/blob/master/drafts/key_agility.rst


Client Library
--------------

Early unfinished draft specification document:
* https://github.com/katzenpost/docs/blob/master/drafts/client.rst

After this draft specification document is completed additional composable
libraries should be designed which have more sophisticated encryption as
provided by the Signal Double Ratchet or OTRv4.


Rustification
=============

The goal should be binary compatibility with the golang implementation
of Katzenpost such that the existing golang components can
interoperate with the new Rust components. Perhaps the biggest advantage
of using Rust would be for writing mixnet clients as opposed to mix servers.
A Rust mixnet client could easily present a FFI that could be used by
user interfaces written in Java for Android and Swift for iOS.

I wrote several relavant rust crates:

* https://crates.io/crates/aez
* https://crates.io/crates/ecdh_wrapper
* https://crates.io/crates/mix_link
* https://crates.io/crates/rust-lioness
* https://crates.io/crates/epoch
* https://crates.io/crates/sphinx_replay_cache
* https://crates.io/crates/sphinxcrypto


Sphinx binary compatibility
---------------------------

* https://crates.io/crates/sphinxcrypto

The rust Sphinx uses the exact same cryptographic primitives
as the golang implementation. Therefore it should be fairly
easy to make them binary compatible. They should share test vectors.


Mix link layer binary compatibility
-----------------------------------

* https://crates.io/crates/mix_link

Currently this mix link layer crate uses ``Noise_XX_25519_ChaChaPoly_BLAKE2b``
however if the Katzenpost link layer were to upgrade to
Kyber then the task of making this crate binary compatibility
would be greatly simplified.

Here's an implementation of Kyber:

* https://crates.io/crates/kyber

This ``mix_link`` crate uses the snow Noise protocol library implementation:

* https://crates.io/crates/snow

However we SHOULD patch snow with Kyber PQ KEM hybrid forward secrecy.
Here's the snow github ticket for this task:

* https://github.com/mcginty/snow/issues/39


Mix server
----------

Current work in progress rust mix server:

* https://github.com/david415/mix_server

Development progress has halted due to not being able to interoperate
with the existing Katzenpost Directory Authority system.
