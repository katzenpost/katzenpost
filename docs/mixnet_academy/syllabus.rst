Learn Mix Networks for Great Good
*********************************

(maybe the second title should be: Prevent Murder using Mathematics)


Course Syllabus And Reading List
================================

There are no good introductory papers on mix networks. Instead, the
approach is to read all the really important academic papers on mix
networks. These papers are roughly organized into several categories
such as:

.. contents:: :local:

Missing from this list are ``verified shuffles``. These are
specialized mix strategies which at times are very useful for specific
use cases such as ``voting``.

In a few of these mixnet sections I have included youtube videos I've
made to help explain some of the fundamental mixnet concepts. As you
read these mixnet papers keep in mind that decryption mixnets have the
following attack categories:

* tagging attacks
* n-1 attacks
* compulsion attacks
* statistical disclosure attacks
* epistemic attacks

After all this mix network literature we turn to the
``Classical Packet Switching Network Literature`` below in the next major section
of reading. Many of these important papers happen to not be academic
papers but rather come from industry/IETF and are RFCs. Why read these?
Aren't mixnet papers enough? Yes if you want to only publish papers on mix
networks then reading about only mix networks may be enough.

However if you want to design real world mix network systems then
understanding the mathematical limitations of the packet switching
networking design space is extremely important! You must read about
the early Internet design mistakes to understand what not to do in
your mix network designs. In your mix network designs you must take
care to avoid such fatal conditions such as **Congestion Collapse**.

Have questions? Sit on them for a week and voraciously read papers.
If you still have questions then do feel free to ask me. We have a mailing
list and IRC channel for such things:
