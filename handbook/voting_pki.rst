Katzenpost Voting Directory Authority
=====================================

Overview
--------

Most of the mixnet papers are written with the assumption that
the mixnet's PKI exists and performs their functions perfectly.
Our mixnet PKI is a so called Directory Authority design which is
inspired by the Tor's and Mixminion's Directory Authority.


For more details about the design of the Katzenpost voting PKI
you should see our specification document:

* https://github.com/katzenpost/docs/blob/master/specs/pki.rst


As with Katzenpost clients and mixes, this authority server uses our
post quantum cryptographic noise based wire protocol as described
in the specification document:

* https://github.com/katzenpost/docs/blob/master/specs/wire-protocol.rst

Each authority's configuration has the public link layer key
of each of it's peers for authenticating the wire protocol connection.

Peers are also configured with each other's public signing key so that they
may verify each other's signatures on votes. The voting system is used to
create a document describing the collective view of the network. Mixnet clients
download the consensus document so that they may utilize the network to route
their Sphinx packets.

CLI usage of The Voting Directory Authority
-------------------------------------------

The voting authority has the following commandline usage::

   ./voting -h
   Usage of ./voting:
     -f string
           Path to the authority config file. (default "katzenpost-authority.toml")
     -g    Generate the keys and exit immediately.

The ``-g`` option is used to generate the public and private signing and link keys.


Configuring The Voting Directory Authority
----------------------------------------------

A sample configuration file can be found in our docker repository, here:

* https://github.com/katzenpost/docker


Authority section
`````````````````

The Authority section contains information which is mandatory,
for example::

  [Authority]
    Addresses = [ "192.0.2.1:29483", "[2001:DB8::1]:29483" ]
    DataDir = "/var/lib/katzenpost-authority"

* ``Addresses`` contains one or more IP addresses which
  correspond to local network interfaces to listen for connections on.
  These can be specified as IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.

* ``DataDir`` specifies the absolute path to the server's
  state files including the keypair use to sign network consensus
  documents.


Logging section
```````````````

The logging section controls the logging, for example::

  [Logging]
    Disable = false
    File = "/var/log/katzenpost.log"
    Level = "DEBUG"

* ``Disable`` is used to disable logging if set to ``true``.

* ``File`` specifies the file to log to. If omitted then stdout is used.

* ``Debug`` may be set to one of the following:

* ERROR
* WARNING
* NOTICE
* INFO
* DEBUG

Parameters section
``````````````````

The Parameters section holds the network parameters, for example::

  [Parameters]
    SendRatePerMinute = 30
    Mu = 0.00025
    MuMaxDelay = 9000
    LambdaP = 15.0
    SendShift = 3
    LambdaPMaxDelay = 3000
    LambdaL = 0.00025
    LambdaLMaxDelay = 9000
    LambdaD = 0.00025
    LambdaDMaxDelay = 9000
    LambdaM = 0.00025
    LambdaMMaxDelay = 9000

* ``SendRatePerMinute`` is the rate limiter maximum allowed rate of
  packets per client.

* ``Mu`` is the inverse of the mean of the exponential
  distribution that the Sphinx packet per-hop mixing delay will be
  sampled from.

* ``MuMaxDelay`` is the maximum Sphinx packet per-hop mixing
  delay in milliseconds.

* ``LambdaP``  LambdaP is the inverse of the mean of the exponential distribution
  that **clients** will sample to determine the time interval between sending
  messages from it's FIFO egress queue or drop decoy messages if the queue
  is empty.

* ``LambdaPMaxDelay`` is the maximum send interval for LambdaP in milliseconds

* ``LambdaL`` LambdaL is the inverse of the mean of the exponential distribution
  that **clients** will sample to determine the time interval between sending
  decoy loop messages.

* ``LambdaLMaxDelay`` sets the maximum send interval for LambdaL in milliseconds.

* ``LambdaD`` is the inverse of the mean of the exponential distribution
  that **clients** will sample to determine the time interval between sending
  decoy drop messages.

* ``LambdaDMaxDelay`` is the maximum send interval in milliseconds.

* ``LambdaM`` is the inverse of the mean of the exponential distribution that 
  **mixes** will sample to determine send timing of mix loop decoy traffic.

* ``LambdaMMaxDelay`` sets the maximum delay for LambdaM


Debug Section
`````````````

* ``IdentityKey`` is this authority's EdDSA signing key, in either Base16 OR Base64 format.

* ``LinkKey`` is this authority's ECDH link layer key, in either Base16 OR Base64 format.

* ``Layers`` is the number of non-provider layers in the network topology.

* ``MinNoderPerLayer`` is the minimum number of nodes per layer required to form a valid Document.

* ``GenerateOnly`` if set to true causes the server to halt and clean up the data dir
  right after long term key generation.


Mixes Section
`````````````

The Mixes configuration section looks like this
::

  [[Mixes]]
    IdentityKey = "kAiVchOBwHVtKJVFJLsdCQ9UyN2SlfhLHYqT8ePBetg="

  [[Mixes]]
    IdentityKey = "900895721381C0756D28954524BB1D090F54C8DD9295F84B1D8A93F1E3C17AD8"

* ``IdentityKey`` is the node's EdDSA signing key, in either Base16 OR Base64 format.


Providers Section
`````````````````

Configure like so:
::

   [[Providers]]
     Identifier = "example.com"
     IdentityKey = "0AV1syaCdBbm3CLmgXLj6HdlMNiTeeIxoDc8Lgk41e0="

* ``Identifier`` is the human readable provider identifier, such as a FQDN.

* ``IdentityKey`` is the provider's EdDSA signing key, in either Base16 OR Base64 format.
