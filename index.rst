Katzenpost
**********

Goals
=====

* to *prevent* a sufficiently global passive adversary from learning who is communicating with whom
* to *detect* active attacks against the network infrastructure
* hide message content from participating providers, hide recipient identity from the sender's provider, and the sender identity from the recipient's provider
* support for both "instant messaging" and "email" use cases
* reliable out of order delivery

Non-Goals
=========

* to hide the sender identity from the final recipient
