Katzenpost monorepo
===================

Building from Go source
=======================

Katzenpost now uses hybrid post quantum with classical cryptographic protocols.
As part of this change in our cryptographic protocols we have added the use
of Sphincs+, the stateless hash based post quantum signature scheme.

The katzenpost monorepo now has a copy of the sphincsplus git repo in `katzenpost/sphincsplus/ref`
and in that location we've added some cgo bindings which require this bash
environment variable to be set in order to compile:

.. code-block:: bash

  export CGO_CFLAGS_ALLOW="-DPARAMS=sphincs-shake-256f"

The Katzenpost fork of the sphincs+ ref code was created so that we
could make some necessary changes to the Makefile. However after a
while of using it we realized we also needed to change a few things to
get our cgo bindings to work.
