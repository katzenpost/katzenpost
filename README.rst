Server Library
==============

To build the server see the 'daemons' repo:

https://github.com/Katzenpost/daemons


Building
========

* Note that this library requires a ``go generate`` step before running
``go build`` in order to generate the protobuf and gRPC code for the
Kaetzchen service plugin system. This means you must have some protobuf
related deps installed such as:

 * protobuf-compiler (version 3)
 * golang-goprotobuf-dev
 * protoc-gen-go https://github.com/golang/protobuf/tree/master/protoc-gen-go

* Note that some of our dependencies use ``gopkg.in`` as their import host
and this can cause you problems if you use the ``go get`` tool to install
dependencies. See this issue https://github.com/kataras/iris/issues/605
for more information. tl,dr; workaround -->
::

   git config --global http.https://gopkg.in.followRedirects true
