Double Ratchet Library
======================

This library is a fork of agl's double ratchet in his pond messaging system https://github.com/agl/pond/.
We have made several changes in this fork:

* "post-quantum hybrid ratchet"; CSIDH and ECDH ratchets progress together and both computed shared
  secrets are feed into the root KDF chain
* uses memguard to protect and wipe the memory used to store cryptographic
  key material
* serialization in CBOR instead of protobufs
* this library takes ownership of all key material used
* added methods to perform the complete key exchange
  whereas in pond the code to perform the key exchange was
  spread out and not at all contained with the ratchet code module.
