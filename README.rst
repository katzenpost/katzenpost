Building from Go source
=======================

Katzenpost now uses hybrid post quantum with classical cryptographic protocols.
As part of this change in our cryptographic protocols we have added the use
of Sphincs+, the stateless hash based post quantum signature scheme.

Install this dependency like this:

```
git clone https://github.com/katzenpost/sphincsplus.git
cd sphincsplus/ref
make libsphincsplus.so
sudo make install # installs into /usr/local
sudo ldconfig
```

The Katzenpost fork of the sphincs+ ref code was created so that we could
make some necessary changes to the Makefile so that it builds .so file
and installs into `/usr/local`.
