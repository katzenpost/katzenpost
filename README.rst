the catshadow client
====================

Catshadow is a mix network messaging system. This repository contains
a client library and a client program which can be used with a
Katzenpost mix network. It not only uses strong modern end to end
encryption (PANDA + Signal Double Ratchet), but it is also designed
to reduce the amount of metadata leaked onto the network.

usage
-----

::

  Usage of ../bin/catshadow:
    -f string
        Path to the client config file. (default "katzenpost.toml")
    -g	Generate the state file and then run client.
    -s string
        The catshadow state file path. (default "catshadow_statefile")

Firstly, generate your account and remote spool by running catshadow
with the `-g` option, like so:

   catshadow -f alice.toml -s alice.statefile -g

All subsequent runs must not include the **-g** option.

The following configuration file can be used with our current
test mix network, however it assumes that you have
tor configured with the socks port listening on 127.0.0.1 port 9050.
::

  [UpstreamProxy]
  Type = "socks5"
  Network = "tcp"
  Address = "127.0.0.1:9050"

  [Logging]
  Disable = false
  Level = "DEBUG"
  File = "/home/user/catshadow.log"

  [NonvotingAuthority]
  Address = "37.218.242.147:29485"
  PublicKey = "DFD5E1A26E9B3EF7B3DA0102002B93C66FC36B12D14C608C3FBFCA03BF3EBCDC"

  [Account]
  Provider = "idefix"
  ProviderKeyPin = "PZWT07fWnLsZr8OGibNlvK34Cr/m98T+awhZrr53IJI="

  [Registration]
  Address = "6cwob5th2li7zxqp.onion:29484"
  [Registration.Options]
    Scheme = "http"
    UseSocks = true
    SocksNetwork = "tcp"
    SocksAddress = "127.0.0.1:9050"

  [Debug]
  DisableDecoyTraffic = true
  CaseSensitiveUserIdentifiers = false
  PollingInterval = 1

  [Panda]
  Receiver = "+panda"
  Provider = "ramix"
  BlobSize = 2000


Once you receive the catshadow command prompt **>>>**
you can add a contact with the **add_contact** command.
Your contact and you must enter the exact same passphrase.
Doing so facilitates the exchange of cryptographic key material
and message spool identities.

The PANDA exchange is complete once the catshadow instance prints
a log message like this:
::
  PANDA exchange completed

After the exchange is complete a message can be sent to the contact
using the **send_message** command. The **list_inbox** lists received
messages and their message ID. The **read_inbox** command is used
to read messages specified by message ID.


design
------

It is my understanding that in terms of the analysis presented in this
blog post ( Brian Warner's **"Petmail mailbox-server delivery protocol"**
http://www.lothar.com/blog/53-petmail-delivery/ ),
the catshadow messaging system can be described as:

**S1, M0, R1, Rev0**

Here I rephrase the definitions of the above messaging system
properties: Catshadow clients can compare delivery tokens to determine
if they share contacts. However the message spool server cannot tell
which message came from which sender, not even that two messages came
from the same sender, nor can it determine how many senders might be
configured for each recipient. The recipient cannot use the transport
information to identify the sender. The recipient depends upon
information not visible to the mailbox server to identify the sender,
which means a legitimate (but annoying) sender could flood the server
without revealing which sender they are. Finally, the revocation
behavior is such that the recipient can revoke one or more senders
without involving the remaining senders.

Clients make use of a Sphinx SURB based protocol to retrieve messages
from their remote spool service. The mix network has several providers
which operate spool services which clients can interact with. The
spool service is in fact a seperate process which uses our CBOR/HTTP
over unix domain socket plugin system to communicate with the mix server.

Over time I plan on replacing the spool services with gradually more
sophisticated spool services until I finally have a replicating CRDT
based spool service which can help eliminate single points of failure
in this messaging system.

Clients make use of the PANDA protocol for exchanging spool identities
and the Signal Double Ratchet keys. That is, this messaging system creates
bidirectional metadata leakage resistant communications channels which
are composed with two unidirection channels. Each unidirectional channel
contains the required information to write to a correspondant's
remote message spool.

Katzenpost is a variant of the Loopix design and as such makes use of
the Poisson mix strategy and therefore must be properly tuned. Tuning
of the Poisson mix strategy has not been publicly solved yet but I
suspect the solution has something to do with a discrete network event
simulator and possibly some machine learning algorithms as
well. Perhaps we all should consider the tuning of this mixnet
messaging system as half of its design.

Another unfinished design area is: The Catshadow client periodically
polls the client's remote message spool where the intervals between
polling are the result of a Poisson process. Currently, tuning this
Poisson procress is left unfinished, however, I can state that the
goal in tuning this would be to reduce vulnerability to a long term
statistical disclosure attack where the passive adversary or
compromised Provider tries to link clients with their spool
service. Furthermore, I suspect the tuning for this Poisson process
can be determined as a sufficiently small fraction of the mean
frequency of λPLD which is the aggregate of λP, λD and λL as mentioned
in **"The Loopix Anonymity System"**:

the longer design overview
--------------------------

The design of this messaging is not yet fully specified but is
partially specified in these specification documents:

* https://github.com/katzenpost/docs/blob/master/drafts/client.rst
* https://github.com/katzenpost/docs/blob/master/drafts/deaddrop.rst
* https://github.com/katzenpost/docs/blob/master/drafts/decoy_traffic.rst
* https://github.com/katzenpost/docs/blob/master/drafts/panda.txt

Whereas all those specifications assume the existence of the core
Katzenpost specifications here which mostly covers the design of
the server infrastructure:

* https://github.com/katzenpost/docs/blob/master/specs/mixnet.rst
* https://github.com/katzenpost/docs/blob/master/specs/wire-protocol.rst
* https://github.com/katzenpost/docs/blob/master/specs/kaetzchen.rst
* https://github.com/katzenpost/docs/blob/master/specs/sphinx_replay_detection.rst
* https://github.com/katzenpost/docs/blob/master/specs/sphinx.rst
* https://github.com/katzenpost/docs/blob/master/specs/end_to_end.rst
* https://github.com/katzenpost/docs/blob/master/specs/pki.rst
* https://github.com/katzenpost/docs/blob/master/specs/certificate.rst
